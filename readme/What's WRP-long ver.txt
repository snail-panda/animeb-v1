<p><strong>*Note 3: What's WRP?*</strong></p>
<p>WRP stands for Weekly Ranking Point—a scoring system created to represent one's weekly viewing experience of a single anime episode as truthfully and purely as possible. It should never reflect only subjective values or emotional response, but rather structured thought, quiet and objective observation, and consistent standards—balancing personal sensibility with a solid foundation of carefully and passionately developed criteria.</p>

  <p><strong>Why WRP?</strong></p>
<p>Anime is often experienced as a journey—one cours, one season, twelve or thirteen episodes. But WRP focuses not on the whole, but merely—a single week, or rather, precisely one episode, a fleeting 23 minutes.</p>
<p>It was born from a question that became a mission: <em>How can one episode’s experience be captured as it occurs—in a way that honors its effort, intention, and resonance?</em></p>


  <p>WRP is not a number for number’s sake. It is a reflection of how that episode, in that specific moment, felt and functioned—filtered through a lens that strives to be fair, thoughtful, and aware of both personal reaction and the show’s unique context. This system grew out of years of refinement and inner debate, guided by written criteria, self-discipline, and the sincere desire to engage with anime in the most respectful way possible.</p>

  <p><strong>More Than a Score</strong></p>
  <p>Each rating is built to foster a kind of connection—between viewer and creator, yes, but also with the work itself. At its best, WRP becomes not just a judgment, but a dialogue. The viewer begins to imagine the intent behind the choices, to listen to the quiet voice of direction, animation, and structure, and to let even subtle moments shape their appreciation. It is here that a ranking becomes not just evaluation, but gratitude.</p>

  <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
  <p>The WRP score consists of six foundational elements—not selected based on preference, but because they consistently shape the viewing experience from week to week:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Base Score</li>
    <li>Visual Quality / Animation</li>
    <li>Writing / Narrative Structure</li>
    <li>Direction / Pacing / Composition</li>
    <li>Charm– how much this episode brings out the core appeal of the show—its characters, its world, its tone, or its storytelling identity.</li>
    <li>Overall Quality / Execution	& Episode Satisfaction – the degree of enjoyment, fulfillment, and craftsmanship delivered by the episode as a cohesive, complete experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each element is assessed not by the size of the studio, the popularity of the source material, or the scale of its production—but by the effort and expression shown in the episode itself. What matters is not how grand the resources were, but whether the episode was able to convey something heartfelt, powerful, or simply honest—something that resonates beyond its limitations.</p>

  <p><strong>Final Note</strong></p>
  <p>Though the full scoring guidelines remain private, each evaluation is guided by a quiet, unwavering effort: to meet each episode with sincerity; to respect the creators’ labor, even when critiquing; and to let that 23-minute experience become more than just “watched,” but truly understood. This is what WRP hopes to embody—not just a score, but a way of being with anime in a deeper sense</p>
