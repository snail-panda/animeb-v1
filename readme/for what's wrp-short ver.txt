<p><strong>*Note 3: What's WRP?*</strong></p>
<p>WRP stands for Weekly Ranking Point—a scoring system created to represent one's weekly viewing experience of a single anime episode as truthfully and purely as possible. It should never reflect only subjective values or emotional response, but rather structured thought, quiet and objective observation, and consistent standards—balancing personal sensibility with a solid foundation of carefully and passionately developed criteria.</p>

<p>Rather than judging a show as a whole, WRP focuses on one episode—a single 23-minute weekly experience in the course of a 12-week season.
It may appear to be a tiny and fleeting part of the entire series,
but it is surely an irreplaceable part of one's viewing experience.
WRP was born to capture that.</p>

<p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
  <p>The WRP score consists of six foundational elements—not selected based on preference, but because they consistently shape the viewing experience from week to week:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Base Score</li>
    <li>Visual Quality / Animation</li>
    <li>Writing / Narrative Structure</li>
    <li>Direction / Pacing / Composition</li>
    <li>Charm– how much this episode brings out the core appeal of the show—its characters, its world, its tone, or its storytelling identity.</li>
    <li>Overall Quality / Execution	& Episode Satisfaction – the degree of enjoyment, fulfillment, and craftsmanship delivered by the episode as a cohesive, complete experience.</li>
  </ul>

<p>WRP is, at its core, a mere scoring system.
But it's one built with care and purpose—so that even something as simple as evaluating an episode
can become a way of spending time with anime more thoughtfully, more closely.
It can turn those 23 minutes into more than just something “watched”—
perhaps even into a moment shared with its creator.
That’s what WRP hopes to make possible.
And sometimes, that connection goes even deeper.
