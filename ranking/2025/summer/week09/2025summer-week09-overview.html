  <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
  <p>We’ve now hit <strong>Week 9</strong> of the Summer 2025 anime season.</p>
    <p>Last week felt a bit disjointed—like the cour as a whole hadn’t quite found its rhythm. Now that we’re deep into the late game, how did things shape up this week?</p>
    <p>Let’s dive in and take a look.</p>

  <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
  <section>
    <h5><strong>**Notice**</strong></h5>
    <p>This week saw the official <strong>drop of <em>Dan Da Dan Season 2</em></strong>. That said, an evaluation for its episode is still included, so it remains in this week’s ranking. Starting next week, the pool will shrink to <strong>18 titles</strong>.</p>
      <p>As usual, more detailed impressions—some sharp, others delightfully half-baked—can be found via the <strong>Review</strong> button in the ranking table for each of the Top 5 and the three pickup titles.</p>

  </section>

    <section>
      <p>By Episodes 9 and 10, the shows near the top have largely settled into place. The Top 5—and even down to around 10th—are punching above expectations, whether through steady consistency or surprise bursts of momentum. That’s great for the season overall, though it does make the ranking feel a little less unpredictable.</p><br>

      <h4  class="section-top5">Top 5 (Ranked Works)</h4>
      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
       <li>
  <p><strong><big>1st – Dr. Stone: Science Future Part 2</big></strong> (<em>Dr. Stone: Science Future – 4th Season, 2nd Cour</em>)</p>
          <p>Full impressions are in the review; here’s the short take.</p>
          <p>A blazing, heartfelt episode—<em>truly</em> blazing. The shared belief in building a future through science crystallized on screen, each person’s conviction fusing into one. It felt like the culmination of everything Senku’s been driving toward.</p>
          <p>Quibbles exist, but the momentum and conviction easily outweighed them. And with Luna holding that nitric acid… could her role in resolving petrification finally cement her as Senku’s true partner? We’ll see.</p>
          <br>
</li>

<li>
          <p><strong><big>2nd – Turkey! Time to Strike</big></strong> (<em>Turkey!</em>)</p>
          <p>A powerhouse episode. The “future team” and their Sengoku-era ancestors were tied together cleanly, and the ancestral plotline wrapped in a way that felt earned and surprisingly moving. For all the chaos, the show’s been carefully stacking its pieces.</p>
          <p>Seeing the whole Tokura family—once seemingly scattered—actually moving for Akabi’s sake was especially satisfying. Also, that OP sung by the Tokura sisters’ VAs? Pure fire. To those who bailed early: shame on you.</p>
          <br>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong><big>3rd – April Showers Bring May Flowers</big></strong> (<em>Busu ni Hanataba wo.</em>)</p>
          <p>Uguisudani’s growth shone, and this might be the series’ highest placement so far. Her missteps, clashes with Gotanda, and repeated run-ins with Tabata have been woven carefully—and the resulting shift feels natural and earned.</p>
          <p>Yes, some “chance encounters” between Tabata and Ueno raise eyebrows, but they no longer feel like dealbreakers. Tabata’s steady kindness has been consistently portrayed, so Ueno (and now even Uguisudani) being drawn to him makes sense.</p>
          <p>Overall, a genuinely excellent episode.</p>
          <br>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong><big>4th – Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</big></strong> (<em>Dekin no Mogura</em>)</p>
          <p>Story, characters, and dialogue are all crafted with care and built up steadily, making each episode more rewarding. Even minor or arc-limited characters feel fully realized thanks to meticulous storytelling.</p>
          <p>Yae’s home–island arc was especially captivating—not just the notorious ruling family, but her own relatives were compelling in their own right.</p>
          <br>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p><strong><big>5th – Ruri Rocks</big></strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>)</p>
          <p>One of those episodes that sinks in slowly but deeply. It explored the interplay between nature and human life—water sources, dams, floods, and the communities tied to them—through mineral research. Ruri’s evolving perspective, framed by that “1.9 million tons of natural time capsule,” was quietly moving.</p>
          <p>The fashion-show opener was… a lot. But beyond fanservice, it worked as a contrast to the girls’ genuine brilliance revealed later. Even so, it probably pushed things too far (maid outfits?). Aside from that, the episode was excellent.</p>
          <br>
        </li>

      </ul>
<br>
      <p>Those were the Top 5 quick takes. Now let’s briefly touch on a few notable works outside the main ranking.</p>
      <br>


      <h4 class="three-picks">Spotlight</h4>
<p><strong>The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity</strong> (<em>Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku</em>) — A warm focus on friendship and compassion among the boys. Heartening, though still just shy of cracking the rankings. Close.</p>
      <p><small>*For details, see the review in the ranking table.</small></p>
      <br>

<h4 class="three-picks">Editor’s Pick</h4>
<p><strong>Rent-a-Girlfriend Season 4</strong> (<em>Kanojo, Okarishimasu 4th Season</em>)</p>
      <p>The evergreen complaint stands: “Hurry up and make some progress already!” That said, the grandmother, father, and mother each delivered heartfelt moments that elevated the episode. Mami’s spiral, though, was once again overbearing—more noise than narrative.</p>
      <p><small>*Full impressions in the ranking-table review.</small></p>
      <br>

<h4 class="three-picks">Dookie</h4>
<p><strong>My Dress-Up Darling Season 2</strong> (<em>Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2</em>)</p>
      <p>Honestly, I can’t see the appeal. CloverWorks’ heavy hand leaves things feeling flat for me, and because the show hinges on Marin’s charm—which doesn’t land for me—the episode ended up more frustrating than fun.</p>

<br>

<p>Those were this week’s three pickups outside the Top 5. A few shows ranked below honestly could have slipped into 5th place in a different week, so let’s run through the full list from 6th down to the bottom with some quick notes.</p><br>

    <h4>Quick Comments (titles not covered in the Top 5 & 3 Pickups)</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, these are super-short impressions on the “one-step-away” titles—shows that just missed cracking the Top 5 this week.</p><br>

<p><strong>Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>) — The action scenes were solid, but the story beats didn’t land. Kou’s deduction skills felt way too overblown, and the sequence where he arrives at Anko’s place before Nazuna felt contrived. The whole vampire-transformation setup can’t really be that simple, can it? I’m being tough here, but only because I hold the series to a high standard.</p>

<p><strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuMu</em>) — As entertaining as always. Tenkuubashi’s trivia spiels hit the mark, and the gag about frequency ranges backfiring worked perfectly. The aftermath around the candy shop—suddenly more cats and more college girls—was a great comedic payoff.</p>

<p><strong>Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus</strong> (<em>Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai</em>) — Hard to stay invested this cour. The main couple and the side characters leave me cold. Futaba being so easily swayed was disappointing. Mai showing her star power worked to some extent, and the hot spring scene had a rare spark of charm, but really—three people going on that trip? Not buying it.</p>
<br>

<p>That about covers the “one-step-away” titles worth a quick mention. As for the rest… nothing to say this week.</p>

    <h4>Viewing Status</h4>
    <p><strong>The Summer Hikaru Died</strong> (<em>Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu</em>) returned from a one-week break, bringing the active pool this week back up to <strong>19 titles</strong>.</p>
    <p>This week’s <strong>drop</strong> was <strong>Dan Da Dan Season 2</strong>—I’ll still watch, but I don’t see any value in continuing to score it. No new titles were added. That means the total for next week will be <strong>18 titles</strong>. With several “on the brink” shows still hanging by a thread, we could see more drops very soon.</p>

   <!-- Conclusion -->
  <section class="overview-conclusion">
    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>That wraps up Week 9 of the Summer 2025 season.</p>
    <p>Next up is <strong>Week 10</strong>, the true pre-finale push. Stories are heading into their climax, and most titles will have no choice but to raise the stakes. Some have been steady slow-burns, others have made me wonder “what are they even doing?” Either way, we’re now at the decisive point of the cour. I’ll be watching closely to see how it all plays out.</p>
    <p>If there’s a title you’re watching closely—or an episode that stood out—let me know in the comments!</p>
    <p>See you next week!</p>
