        "en": "Episode #9: Time Capsle of 1.9 Million Tons<p>What stood out in this episode was how beautifully it wove together the themes from the last one—particularly the idea that nature, once touched by human hands, enters a gray zone where good and bad can't be cleanly separated.</p><p>The fashion show in Part A, where Nagi suddenly changes outfits, felt over-the-top at first. Nagi, who normally couldn't care less about what she wears, ends up modeling all sorts of flashy clothes—maid outfits included—brought by Imari, who insists it's time to glam her up. Even Shoko can't help but be drawn to the outfits, hesitating for a moment before Ruri calls her away.</p><p>It felt absurd—but also kind of sweet. Maybe that whole scene was a metaphor in itself: girls are drawn to what sparkles, in all its forms. The episode doesn't deny that. But in the end, it reminds us that what truly shines isn't flashy clothing—it's something much deeper.</p><p>In the early scenes, we see Ruri and Shoko growing closer. Their personalities are so different, yet they begin to connect. And with each new connection, Ruri starts to trust her own judgment more—something that speaks to how far she's come.</p><p>The dam—a literal structure, but also a metaphor—becomes a focal point. There are those who support it and those who oppose it. Just like with nature, there's no single, simple answer.</p><p>Then comes the rain. Heavy rainfall leads the dam to release water, which in turn dislodges opals that had quietly gathered at the bottom over time.</p><p>It's a moment born of coincidence, maybe even miracle. But what made it truly beautiful wasn't just the glittering stones—it was the girls, glowing in their presence. Not because the opals shone, but because they could feel the passage of time, the forces of nature, the quiet intertwining of humanity and the world.</p><p>On the way home, the scene lingers on quiet details—the white line between the sidewalk and the road, the gentle transitions through a sleepy town. Ruri stays awake while the others doze off, gazing out the window. She sees an older woman doting on her dog, children playing with roof tiles, and a girl holding a gleaming opal up to the fading sun.</p><p>When Nagi asks, \"Were you awake?\" Ruri simply replies, \"Yeah. I was looking outside.\"</p><p>That one line hit me.</p><p>I don't know why, but it did.</p><p>Maybe because it captured everything:Her growth. Her openness. Her ability now to see not just stones, but the stories behind them—people, towns, time, weather, accidents, history, connection.</p><p>That white line between the sidewalk and the road—it wasn't just a line. It felt like a river, flowing quietly beneath everything.</p><p>The opals, too, didn't just \"appear.\" They had been resting at the bottom of the dam for who knows how long—formed over thousands of years, and now suddenly freed by a storm. Carried downstream, gently, silently.</p><p>And as Ruri and the others drove down from the mountain, it felt like they were tracing that same path—descending the river of time, carried by everything that had come before them.</p><p>That final shot of the girl discovering an opal in the shallows, holding it to the sunset—it wasn't just a pretty moment. It was the continuation of something much older, something passed along, something precious.</p><p>The dam held a time capsule of 1.9 million tons. But it's not just a number. It's everything that has settled there: time, memories, sediment, history, light.</p><p>And now, piece by piece, those fragments are returning to the world—flowing through rivers, through people, through towns.</p><p>Ruri saw it. Felt it.</p><p>That's why she looked outside.That's why she glowed.</p><br><p>Afterword</p><p></p>Looking back on it, I couldn't help but think that the thin white line between the sidewalk and the road was more than just a line. It felt like a river, flowing steadily downstream—from the mountain's heights, through the lives of people in towns below, carrying with it both what nature has spent ages shaping and what humanity has built with its own hands.<p></p>The dam, with its 1.9 million tons of water, was like a time capsule. What had slept quietly inside—sediment, minerals, fragments of history—was released, carried along, and returned to the world. That flow reached not only rivers and shallows, but also the daily lives of people who might never notice it.<p></p>And as Ruri looked outside on the way back—at the quiet town, at people and small moments of life—it felt as if her eyes were reflecting that same current. Perhaps she wasn't even \"thinking\" about it. She was simply feeling it: the weight of years, the gift of nature, and the way it all flows into human lives.<p></p>That's why her one line—\"I was looking outside\"—hit so deeply.Because in that simple reply, everything was already there.</p><br>",

        "en": "Episode #22: So, We're Gonna Do It All Right Now?!<p>Wait, was this really My Dress-Up Darling or an episode of Rent-A-Girlfriend? For 23 straight minutes, it felt like the latter—and it was torture. Not a single second felt genuinely entertaining.</p><p>Sure, Marin is cute… but is that really enough to carry an entire episode? If you're a diehard Marin fan, maybe. If not, there's just nothing here. And honestly, I can't help but wonder: is CloverWorks actually gifted at taking something with potential and draining the fun out of it?</p><p>The infamous \"energy drink\" gag was unbearable. Gojou, being the painfully earnest and clueless introvert he is, decides that the best way to handle staying overnight at Marin's is simply… not to sleep. So he grabs an energy drink at Don Quijote, determined to power through. Straightforward enough.</p><p>Except Marin sees him at the shelf next to some \"extra stamina\" boosters and totally misreads it. She convinces herself he's revved up in that way, and she spirals into full-blown panic mode. She literally blurts out \"I'm definitely going to confess!\"—making her feel exactly like Kazuya from Rent-A-Girlfriend, all hyped up and overreacting over nothing. It wasn't endearing, it was insufferable.</p><p>And the nonsense just piled up. Marin's supposed to be dieting, yet she wolfs down instant noodles at midnight and then casually sleeps until morning. This is a professional model who's about to show up at a cosplay event—seriously? Then there was the game sequence tied to the next cosplay theme. Yes, CloverWorks animated it with their usual polish, but honestly? It was well-crafted yet utterly irrelevant.</p><p>That's the core problem: Marin is already an ultra-popular, beautiful high school model. She conveniently has the perfect partner in Gojou—raised in a traditional dollmaker's household, skilled in sewing and makeup, and passionate enough to handcraft her costumes. She even eats dinner at his place almost every night, cooked by him and his grandfather, like it's the most natural thing in the world. And after all that, she still spends an entire episode melting down over a total misunderstanding. What's supposed to be funny just comes across as ridiculous.</p><p>In the end, it all boiled down to one thing: I just didn't care. Maybe others found this fun—I honestly don't know. But for me, watching it was exhausting.</p><br>",
