「chuggin’ up」について

「inch up」に近い表現を若者が言ってたなら、もしかして聞き取りの関係で chuggin’ along / chugging up が耳に入ったのかも。

chug along
→ ゆっくりだけど着実に進む。
→ 例：The project is chugging along.
（プロジェクトは少しずつ進んでるよ）

chug up（あまり一般的ではない）
→ 上り坂をガタゴト進むイメージ。電車や車にもよく使う。
→ 例：The old train chugged up the hill.
（古い列車が丘をゴトゴト登っていった）

だからもしジェイレン君が「chuggin’ up」って言ったとしたら、ニュアンス的には「ゆっくりだけど前に進んでる」って意味で合ってると思う。
まさにじんちゃんが感じた「inch up」系の感覚だね。

💡 ポイント

inch up → ちょっとずつ進む、上がる（物理的にも比喩的にも）。

chug along → 着実に進む（進行感がある）。

chug up → 坂や困難を「ゴトゴト」上る。

つまり全部「進んでいく」系だけど、

inch = 細かく慎重

chug = ゆっくりでも力強く

head-on collision, multi-vehicle collision, struck from behind → formal / news reports.

So if you’re telling a friend at SingleCut 🍺:

“Yeah, man, some guy totally T-boned me.”

But if you’re filling out an insurance claim:

“My vehicle was struck in a side-impact collision at an intersection.”

😅 Same event, two completely different tones.
