<section class="overview-intro">
  <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
  <p>We’ve now reached <strong>Week 10</strong> of the Summer 2025 anime season.</p>
  <p>With most shows hitting Episodes 10 or 11, the stories are pushing toward their climaxes—and many have kicked into high gear. (That said, a handful still feel stubbornly slow-burn…) With finales right around the corner, how did this week’s ranking shake out?</p>
  <p>Let’s dive in and take a look!</p>

  <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
  <section>
    <h5><strong>**Notice**</strong></h5>
    <p>As mentioned last week, <strong><em>Dan Da Dan Season 2</em></strong> has officially been dropped from evaluation and no longer appears in the rankings. That said, since the show is entering its own endgame, I’m still watching—so expect it to show up in the final ranking and the Tier List. (Reassuring? …Not sure about that.)<br>
    This week’s active pool therefore stands at <strong>18 titles</strong>.</p>

    <p>As usual, more detailed impressions—whether sharp or scattershot—can be found via the <strong>Review</strong> button in the ranking table for each of the Top 5 and the three pickup titles.</p>
  </section>

    <section>
      <p>The lineup at the top—and the three pickups highlighted for various reasons—looks quite different from what we might have predicted earlier in the cour. Discovering and savoring these shifts is one of the real joys of following a season week by week.<br>
    So, shall we dive straight into the No. 1 spot? …Well, almost. A quick note first.</p>

    <p>This week’s overview is trimmed down a little compared to usual due to circumstances. Still, the reviews in the ranking table (both EN and JP) are fully fleshed out, so please check those out for the complete takes. Thanks for understanding!</p>

    <h4 class="section-top5">Top 5 (Ranked Works)</h4>
      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
       <li>
        <p><strong><big>1st – Turkey! Time to Strike</big></strong> (<em>Turkey!</em>)</p>
        <p>See the full impressions in the review; here’s just a quick note.</p>

        <p>Once again, the show’s manic energy, sheer commitment, and that wild, over-the-top final stretch completely bowled me over.</p>

        <p>Yes, on paper it’s “you know the type,” and sure, it looks just as absurd as the glut of isekai-reincarnation shows out there—especially, recent ones. But unlike those hollow messes, this one's driven by real passion, with a throughline you can actually feel. And not to mention, it's not isekai or reincarnation at all—it's just plain time travel.</p><br>
      </li>

<li>
  <p><strong><big>2nd – Dr. Stone: Science Future Part 2</big></strong> (<em>Dr. STONE SCIENCE FUTURE – Final Season, 2nd Cour</em>)</p>
  <p>Full thoughts are in the review; here’s the quick take.</p>

  <p>Now that we’re deep into the endgame, the show has been relentlessly intense—shaking me to the core again and again. Everything the cast has worked toward has crystallized, and you can feel that unshakable conviction in every moment. Even Xeno and Stanley, with all their history, act without hesitation or doubt. As Senku himself put it: they don’t “choose” their path—they simply do what must be done. That resolve hit hard, regardless of which side they’re on.</p>

  <p>Honestly, next week feels like it’ll be an inevitable tearjerker. Please, anything but the cruelest version of a revival—like one poor survivor finally crafting revival fluid, only to… yeah, I couldn’t bear it.</p><br>
</li>

        <li>
  <p><strong><big>3rd – April Showers Bring May Flowers</big></strong> (<em>Busu ni Hanataba wo.</em>)</p>
  <p>As with the others, see the review for the full impressions. Here’s the short version.</p>

  <p>Uguisudani finally had her big moment—but it worked precisely because of everything she’s gone through up until now. The portrayal wasn’t flashy, but it was packed with sincerity and warmth, and it landed beautifully.</p>

  <p>Tabata’s grounded humanity continues to shine, and Gotanda was burning with passion this week too. The ending—Shimbashi, Ueno, and the band’s performance—didn’t try to play it up theatrically. Instead, it projected their feelings plainly, as they are. That honesty made it hit even harder. Shimbashi, respect. And Ueno too.</p>

  <p>I really like this cast. They’re all solid, likable, and believable.</p><br>
</li>

<li>
  <p><strong><big>4th – The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity</big></strong> (<em>Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku</em>)</p>
  <p>Details are in the review—here’s the quick impression.</p>

  <p>Unfair again! And this time it’s the father. (I’d honestly thought this was a single-mother household—just me?)</p>

  <p>Once again, the show kept things grounded instead of melodramatic, which made the story feel genuine. This week’s episode, like Rintarou’s cake, was warm, sweet, and tinged with a few tears.</p>

  <p>Subaru was great again—but is she maybe a little too good to be true? (Not a complaint—she’s awesome.)</p><br>
</li>

<li>
  <p><strong><big>5th – Me and the Alien MuMu</big></strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuMu</em>)</p>
  <p>See the review for the full breakdown; here’s just the short note.</p>

  <p>Once again, right before the finale, the show picked up speed. It wasn’t about one standout moment so much as the overall tempo and direction—it was sharp, fun, and engaging from start to finish.</p>

  <p>Short note this time, but that’s how it felt. Personally, I’d love to see a sequel—here’s hoping.</p><br>
</li>

      </ul>
<br>
      <p>Those were the Top 5 quick takes. Now let’s briefly touch on a few notable works outside the main ranking.</p>
      <br>


      <h4 class="three-picks">Spotlight</h4>
<p><strong>Solo Camping for Two</strong> (<em>Futari Solo Camp</em>)</p>
<p>Again, see the review for the full writeup—this is just the short take.</p>

<p>It was one of those episodes where every little part clicked. There’s no one huge standout, but the whole package landed smoothly, with a nice balance of fun and comfort. Honestly, it reminded me of why I picked up this show in the first place—it’s just a straightforward, satisfying watch.</p>
<br>

<h4 class="three-picks">Editor’s Pick</h4>
<p><strong>Clevatess</strong> (<em>Clevatess: Majuu no Ou to Akago to Kabane no Yuusha</em>)</p>
<p>Full thoughts are in the review; here’s the short version.</p>

<p>Once again, this show proves it knows how to handle its own darkness. The story’s still brutal, but it doesn’t drown in edge for edge’s sake—the beats carry weight, and you can feel the intent behind them. It’s not pretty, but it’s compelling. That’s why it earned this week’s Editor’s Pick spot.</p>
<br>

<h4 class="three-picks">Dookie</h4>
<p><strong>Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus</strong> (<em>Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai</em>)</p>
<p>Details are in the review—this is the short note.</p>

<p>I just can’t get into it. The characters feel hollow, and the emotional beats don’t land. There are a few sparks—like Mai showing her star power—but they can’t carry the weight of the cour. For me, it’s more frustrating than enjoyable, and that lands it in the Dookie slot this week.</p>
<br>

<p>Those were this week’s three pickups outside the Top 5. A few shows ranked below honestly could have slipped into 5th place in a different week, so let’s run through the full list from 6th down to the bottom with some quick notes.</p><br>


<!-- Ranks 6 and Below -->
      <section>
    <h4>Ranks 6 and Below</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">

  <li>8th: <strong>My Dress-Up Darling Season 2</strong> (<em>Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2</em>)</li>
  <li>9th: <strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>)</li>

</ul>

    <br>

    <h4>Quick Comments (titles not covered in the Top 5 & 3 Pickups)</h4>
<p>Normally, this is where I’d give some super-quick impressions of the “one-step-away” titles—but as mentioned above, that section’s been cut this week due to circumstances.</p><br>

<!--
<p><strong>Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>) — The action scenes were solid, but the story beats didn’t land. Kou’s deduction skills felt way too overblown, and the sequence where he arrives at Anko’s place before Nazuna felt contrived. The whole vampire-transformation setup can’t really be that simple, can it? I’m being tough here, but only because I hold the series to a high standard.</p>

<p><strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuMu</em>) — As entertaining as always. Tenkuubashi’s trivia spiels hit the mark, and the gag about frequency ranges backfiring worked perfectly. The aftermath around the candy shop—suddenly more cats and more college girls—was a great comedic payoff.</p>

<p><strong>Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus</strong> (<em>Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai</em>) — Hard to stay invested this cour. The main couple and the side characters leave me cold. Futaba being so easily swayed was disappointing. Mai showing her star power worked to some extent, and the hot spring scene had a rare spark of charm, but really—three people going on that trip? Not buying it.</p>
<br>

<p>That about covers the “one-step-away” titles worth a quick mention. As for the rest… nothing to say this week.</p>

    <h4>Viewing Status</h4>
    <p>Since <strong>Dan Da Dan Season 2</strong> dropped last week, this week’s active ranking pool stands at <strong>18 titles</strong>.</p><br>

  <p>No additional drops this week.</p>
  <p>No new titles were added either.</p>

  <p>That means next week’s ranking will also feature <strong>18 titles</strong>. However, with many shows reaching their finales, the following week will inevitably see the total shrink significantly.</p><br>
</section>

   <!-- Conclusion -->
  <section class="overview-conclusion">
  <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>That wraps up Week 10 of the Summer 2025 anime season.</p>

  <p>Next week is <strong>Week 11</strong>—the true endgame, with some shows heading into their finales and others right on the brink.</p>

  <p>It’s bound to be exciting, but my feelings are complicated. Some titles, no matter how they end, won’t leave much of an impression. Others, though, I literally can’t take my eyes off—“I can’t wait for next week!” or even “Please don’t end!” This range of emotions is what makes this Summer 2025 season feel like such a rare one in recent years. In any case, I’ll be watching closely right to the very end.</p>

  <p>As always, if there’s a title you’re following—or an episode you thought was especially good—let me know in the comments!</p>

  <p>See you next week!</p>
