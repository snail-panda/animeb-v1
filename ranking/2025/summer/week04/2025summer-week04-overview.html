    <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
     <p>We’re already nearing the halfway point of the Summer 2025 anime season—it’s gone by in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>In fact, there’s <em>one</em> show that’s already reaching its final episode this week, which feels almost surreal.</p>

<p>That said, based on how things are playing out, it really <em>doesn’t</em> feel like we’re already approaching the midseason mark.</p>

<p>So how did everything stack up in this rather chaotic week? Let’s dive into the latest rankings and take a closer look.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
   <p>Alright, let’s dive into the Highlights & Thoughts section. It's a bit long this time, but I hope you stick with me.</p>

<p>Before we get into the actual rankings, I want to make one quick note: the show ranked #4 this week, <strong>Hotel Inhumans</strong> (<em>Hotel Inhumans</em>), was originally not part of the ranking. That’s because it was dropped from the main evaluation pool after episode 2. But I kept watching it anyway, and episodes 3 and 4 were surprisingly good. Then, as I was finalizing this ranking page, I watched episode 5—and it blew me away. It was so good that I had to reconsider. So despite being technically out of competition, episode 4 ended up making it into the rankings. This is a one-time exception. From next week, the show officially rejoins the main pool.</p>

<p><strong>Takopi’s Original Sin</strong> (<em>Takopii no Genzai</em>)<br>
This week was the finale—episode 6 of 6. While opinions seem somewhat split, I found it to be a powerful and impactful final episode. Interestingly, instead of extending the runtime as some expected, the final episode was a bit shorter, yet incredibly dense and emotionally packed. I wrote a full-length review of the finale, so please check that out for a deeper dive. But as you can see from the score and ranking, this was a truly remarkable piece of work. Whether or not it resonates with you personally, I hope it prompts deep thought and reflection. And I also strongly hope this show reaches as many hearts as possible—not just eyes. It's the kind of story that may quietly shift something inside you. Huge thanks and respect to the entire creative team. What a beautiful ending.</p>

<p><strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>)<br>
I actually watched this on Monday and immediately felt it was this week’s #1—and that impression is backed by the 11-point score you see. I also posted reviews in both English and Japanese, so please check them out for a more in-depth take. All I can say here is: please watch this show. <strong>Takopi’s Original Sin</strong> (<em>Takopii no Genzai</em>) showed one form of anime excellence, and <strong>Kijin Gentoushou</strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>) shows another. There was something quietly overwhelming about this episode. It didn’t rely on grand gestures or visual spectacle—it simply lingered, gently, and moved something deep inside me. It felt like being pulled into a dream, or a memory. Or maybe something that had long been buried, but never really gone. The vision that Jin’ya saw wasn’t just his own—it was shaped by both his deepest longing and Yuunagi’s own emotions. Somehow, their hearts resonated, and what unfolded was a shared illusion—one that quietly spoke to me too, as if I were part of it. It’s the kind of story that makes you cry without knowing why… But somewhere deep down, you do know why. Because it touches that quiet part of us—the one that still remembers, still hopes, still grieves. And maybe… still dreams. That’s how deeply touching and quietly powerful this episode was.</p>

<p><strong>See You Tomorrow at the Food</strong> (<em>Food Court de, Mata Ashita</em>)<br>
Like the top two, I’ve posted a full review of this one. With every episode, my affection for the show—and especially for the two lead girls—keeps growing. The writing, direction, and overall structure are excellent, and their relationship is compelling. I’m honestly in love with the show now, though I try to stay objective when ranking. Like <strong>Takopi’s Original Sin</strong> (<em>Takopii no Genzai</em>), this is also a 6-episode series, so only two episodes remain. I already fear the emotional impact of the finale. This might not be for everyone, but if you dropped it early, I strongly recommend sticking with it. It’s been carefully thought out and beautifully executed.</p>

<p><strong>Hotel Inhumans</strong> (<em>Hotel Inhumans</em>)<br>
As I mentioned earlier, this is technically an exception. Initially, it felt hard to get into—a hotel for assassins run by two concierges is a pretty odd premise, and the tone has a distinct early-2000s flair that some may find off-putting. I dropped it after episode 2, feeling it was confusing and hard to connect with. But with each new episode, it revealed more depth and intentionality. The one-episode structure works well, and I now feel it’s made with genuine care and creative intent. If you tried it and gave up early, I highly recommend checking out episodes 3 and 4. It might surprise you.</p>

<p><strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>)<br>
Having Ruri at #5 is a happy result. This show has consistently been among the top since the start of the season, helping carry the entire season while others were still finding their footing. This week’s episode focused mostly on the lab, with Ruri exploring the microscopic world through a lens. But this tiny world is deeply connected to the larger world outside, offering meaningful insights. One of the highlights was a scene where Ruri distinguishes between skipping steps out of laziness versus optimizing and eliminating the unnecessary—a nuanced and valuable message. Her growing dynamic with Imari was also great. And once again, Nagi-san was an outstanding mentor figure. Sometimes she leads Ruri directly, other times she holds back just enough to let Ruri think, explore, and arrive at answers on her own. That balance is handled so well—it really stood out this week. It looks like her classmates may get more involved soon, which should broaden the story. My only (very minor) concern: Ruri, as a high school student, seems to come and go from this university research lab a bit more freely than you’d expect for someone technically considered an outsider. I’m sure it’s been cleared behind the scenes—Nagi-san and Imari are obviously supportive—but still, it makes me quietly wonder: would this really be okay in the real world? That aside, the show remains lovely as ever.</p>

<p>Now, let’s talk about some notable non-ranked shows.</p>

<p><strong>Turkey!</strong> (<em>Turkey!</em>)<br>
Turkey! is my positive surprise of the week. After episode 1’s bizarre twist, episodes 2 and 3 seemed to spell doom. But this week’s episode really turned things around. It focused on Rina, and while it had a heavy use of flashbacks, it was clearly built on foundations laid earlier. The emotional depth and evolving relationships between the girls are starting to shine. Honestly, I thought it might sneak into the rankings this week, but other shows were just too strong. Still, this has real potential moving forward. If you quit after episode 1, you might be missing out.</p>

<p><strong>The Summer Hikaru Died</strong> (<em>Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu</em>)<br>
Unfortunately, this one’s a disappointment—at least for me. Last week, I praised it quite a bit, but this episode just didn’t work. It leans hard into occult and horror vibes. If that’s your thing, you might enjoy it, but I found it to be unsettling in the worst way. After last week’s more grounded character development, this week felt incoherent. The ghostly wig scene in the bath was bizarre, and character reactions were oddly detached. I still feel no emotional connection to either Hikaru or Arata. Their classmates? The so-called friends? Honestly, I have no idea who they even are. They barely appear, have no presence, and I couldn’t name a single one of them. The show is trying to be meaningful and BL-coded, but it’s not landing.</p>

<p><strong>Secrets of the Silent Witch</strong> (<em>Silent Witch: Chinmoku no Majo no Kakushigoto</em>)<br>
This wasn’t the worst show this week (that honor goes to <strong>Grand Blue Dreaming Season 2</strong> (<em>Grand Blue 2nd Season</em>)), but Dookie is still a big mess. I initially had high hopes—even praised it—but now I’m honestly embarrassed. It’s all about showing off the ultra-powerful, ultra-cute witch Monica Norton. But everything just magically happens for her in the most convenient ways. She’s overpowered one moment and helpless the next for the sake of plot. It’s lazy and nonsensical. And the episode even starts with a giant monster suddenly rampaging through the city—like, right before the opening. Out of nowhere. Then some random boy tries to fight it, and Monica Norton is just… there, hiding behind a clock tower for some reason. She secretly enhances the boy’s spell with her own overpowered magic, and together (though really just her), they defeat the monster. It makes zero sense. And then—what? That same boy shows up at school like nothing happened? Clearly, the entire scene existed just to manufacture their first encounter. But it’s so absurd and disconnected from everything else that I literally thought I skipped an episode. I went back and checked the end of the previous one—no monster, no setup, no warning. Just straight into chaos. Absolutely infuriating and a true trainwreck of a show.</p>

<p>So there you have it: the Top 5 ranked shows, three spotlighted non-ranked titles, and my current thoughts. No shows were dropped this week, and no new additions either (officially just not yet). Overall, while the average quality remains decent, only a few shows truly stand out. That’s where things are for now.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>And that wraps up the Week 4 coverage of the Summer 2025 anime season.</p>

<p>One of this season’s leading titles, <strong>Takopi’s Original Sin</strong> (<em>Takopii no Genzai</em>), has come to an end—but it did so beautifully. At the same time, it’s great to see <strong>Hotel Inhumans</strong> (<em>Hotel Inhumans</em>) making a strong comeback. With that, I think we’re in for a really exciting mid-season stretch. As we approach the halfway point, I expect many titles to pick up steam and reach new heights.</p>

<p>I'm already looking forward to seeing how next week’s rankings will shake out!</p>

<p>So, stay tuned for more Weekly Rankings from the Summer 2025 anime season, and I’ll see you again next week.</p>

<p>As always, if there’s a show you’re enjoying or keeping an eye on, feel free to leave a comment and share your thoughts!</p>

<p>See you next time!</p>
