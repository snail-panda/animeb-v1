    <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
     <p>Here we are in Week 3 of the Summer 2025 anime rankings.</p>
<p>While there haven’t been any major plot developments across the board, there’s been a fair amount of movement within the rankings.</p>
<p>Some shows are still struggling to leave a strong impression, but a few others managed to shine this week with standout episodes.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s dive right into the rankings and see how things played out.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="overview-highlights">
    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
   <p><strong>1. Takopi's Original Sin</strong> (<em>Takopii no Genzai</em>)</p>
<p>Once again, <em>Takopi's Original Sin</em> continues to dominate the Summer 2025 season with overwhelming force. This week’s episode finally revealed the truth behind the time period shown back in episode one—something that had likely left some viewers wondering.</p> 
<p>We’d assumed Takopi had always been by Shizuka’s side, acting purely for her sake. But this week pulled back the curtain and showed us what was really going on. The way it all unfolded was well-paced and compelling.</p>
<p>That said, some moments felt a little too convenient. Due to limited runtime, much was left implied rather than shown. For example, Shizuka suddenly being able to meet her father felt overly smooth—especially considering he lives in a full-auto-lock apartment complex, yet somehow ends up standing outside her door with three kids in tow. The whole thing felt rushed and a bit implausible.</p>
<p>On top of that, the father’s depiction as a terrible parent felt formulaic to the point of cliché. So while I gave the episode a solid 9, I still had mixed feelings about those more forced elements. Don’t get me wrong—it was a good episode, just not without its flaws.</p>

<p><strong>2. Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>)</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this is another series that’s leading the season. This week’s episode was truly excellent.</p>
<p>It beautifully explored the contrast between Ruri (paired with Nagi) and Imari—Ruri, who’s constantly trying to carve her own current and future path with her own hands and her own eyes, versus Imari, who finds meaning through things others have discovered and recorded long ago—like books, maps, and mineralogy-related texts. In her view, what was once uncovered still holds value now, especially in fields like geology and mineralogy, where records and findings rarely change over time, and may even hold greater value today.</p> 
 

<p>Both parts of the episode, A and B, were incredibly well crafted. The way their relationship unfolded felt emotionally rich and thematically powerful. Watching young Ruri and Nagi, who acts as her gentle shepherd, each possessing a gem-like clarity in how they see the world, was beautiful. At one point, Nagi even challenges Imari: “Why don’t you try seeking and seeing things with your own eyes and hands?” It was a touching and pivotal moment.</p>
<p>The visual storytelling also continues to impress. Once again, scenes of glimmering fluorite blanketing the landscape were breathtaking. That said, I personally felt that some of the shots—particularly those focusing on Ruri’s thighs—were a bit excessive. Using such elements to draw attention felt cheap and somewhat off-putting.</p>
<p>Still, despite that, the episode was emotionally resonant and visually stunning. Another strong showing from a standout series.</p>

<p><strong>3. Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>)</p>
<p>Ranking third this week is <em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>, one of my personal favorites. Carrying over from the Spring season into its second cour, it continues to deliver truly remarkable episodes.</p>
<p>In fact, I find it incredible—and even moving—that in this day and age, a show like this is being made with such care and sincerity. While its animation can’t quite match top-tier battle anime, and yes, there are moments when the character faces or movement look a bit off, I’ve never once felt like this show was cutting corners.</p>
<p>Quite the opposite, actually. It feels like everyone involved is pouring in everything they have. And if something is lacking, the script or the performances rise up to compensate. Even if the visuals can’t compete with higher-budget titles, the creators are constantly striving to craft powerful cuts and scenes that matter. You can feel their passion in every frame.</p>
<p>This week’s episode focused on the final years of the Edo period. It was both refreshing and fascinating to see how the series chose to depict that time. Of course, since the show spans from the Edo era to modern day, it makes sense—but even so, this depiction felt uniquely captivating.</p>
<p>The episode explored the ways samurai, humans, and demons alike were swept up in a time of transition. Some were dragged by the tides, some tried to lead the way, and some resisted change altogether. The show portrayed all of this not through abstract ideas, but through people—their perspectives, their struggles, and the lives around them.</p>
<p>It left me with the impression that whether human or demon, no one escapes being left behind by time. Change is inevitable; we can’t deny it. And yet—there are things we desperately wish to preserve. That tension—of wanting to change, but also not wanting to lose something precious—is what this episode captured so poignantly.</p>
<p>There’s a sense of helplessness and sorrow in following the great current of time. It might be the nature of impermanence itself. And yet, seeing that struggle through the eyes of those who live it—those who resist, endure, or simply witness it—made this episode deeply moving. Once again, a powerful and rich installment from a remarkable series.</p>

<p><strong>4. Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</strong> </p>
<p>This is definitely a show that’s not for everyone. It can feel inaccessible, and honestly, it’s tough to pin down or even evaluate by traditional standards. It’s not so much about plot development or character arcs, but more about the strange, unsettling energy that the whole work radiates or everything mixed together.</p> 
<p>Personally, I’m not even in the mood for anything occult right now, and yet—this show still manages to pull me in. The characters are compelling, the pacing is sharp, and the visuals and acting are strangely captivating. There’s something about the whole presentation that’s just… fascinating.</p>
<p>At this point, I honestly think skipping this one would be a waste. I still have no idea where it’s going or what exactly it’s trying to say, but the ride is intriguing. This week’s episode continued to deepen that strange pull, and while I can’t say I’m fully “on board,” I also can’t look away.</p>

<p><strong>5. See You Tomorrow at the Food Court</strong> (<em>Food Court de, Mata Ashita.</em>)</p>
<p>This show continues to shine with its brilliant writing and direction. Despite featuring only two characters in nearly every episode, it somehow manages to deliver something truly special each time.</p>
<p>This week was no exception. On the surface, it felt like just another low-key comedy episode—almost like a sketch show. But as always, the structure was more thoughtful than it first appeared. What seemed like separate, random moments actually tied together, sometimes even connecting back to earlier episodes.</p>
<p>What really stands out is how well-defined these two characters have become. Their personalities are completely different, yet you can feel the affection and balance between them. I’ve really come to care about both of them. The writing is sharp, the timing is impeccable, and there’s a quiet emotional undercurrent that sneaks up on you.</p>
<p>Honestly, this show is strangely touching. The chemistry between the two is endlessly entertaining, and the scripts are top-tier. With only six episodes total, I already feel a bit sad that it’s almost over. I’m genuinely glad it aired this season—it’s been one of the nicest surprises.</p>

<p>And now, let’s move on to the titles that didn’t make the top rankings—but still deserve some kind of spotlight.</p>


<p><strong>Spotlight: The Summer Hikaru Died</strong> (<em>Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu</em>)</p>
<p>To be honest, up until now, I hadn’t found this show all that engaging. It just didn’t click with me. Despite the overwhelmingly high praise it’s received, I personally never really got into it. It felt like yet another supernatural title—well-produced, sure, but not emotionally gripping.</p>
<p>That said, this week’s episode finally worked for me. What stood out wasn’t the occult or supernatural elements, but rather the human side of the story. The way the emotions were portrayed felt grounded and believable. For the first time, I felt like I could actually connect with the characters and their relationships.</p>
<p>Until now, I didn’t really feel anything toward Hikaru or the other protagonist (whose name I keep forgetting). But this episode showed more of their inner struggles—past and present—and how they clash emotionally. That made a real impact. Their dynamic finally felt tangible.</p>
<p>Sure, some of the usual tropes were still there—the spiritually sensitive old lady and the cryptic folklore talk about mountains and villages—but this time, they didn’t get in the way. I still don’t quite understand what’s going on with all the “something in the mountain” stuff, and honestly, I don’t care that much. But for once, I genuinely enjoyed the episode. That says something.</p>

<p><strong>Editor’s Pick (Negative): Dandadan</strong> (<em>Dandadan</em>)</p>
<p>To be honest, I’m seriously considering dropping this show from the rankings entirely. That’s how frustrating it’s become.</p>
<p>I used to love Dandadan during its first cour. I genuinely pushed for it. But somewhere around the last part of that cour—the beginning of JiJis's arc where we are now—, things started to go off the rails. The wild action, constant momentum, and visual flashiness began to overpower the core appeal the show used to have.</p> 
<p>Now, it feels more like a loud, over-the-top action series you’d expect from a big-name Shonen Jump title—something with impressive animation, sure, but with the heart and substance getting drowned out. It’s as if the show decided that throwing everything at the screen would be enough, but it’s not.</p>
<p>When anything can happen at any time, and there are no real stakes or focus, it all starts to feel meaningless. That’s where I’m at with Dandadan right now. Honestly, it’s disappointing. The original charm has been diluted, and it’s getting harder and harder to care about what’s happening on screen.</p>

<p><strong>Turkey!</strong></p> 
<p>And here it is—this week’s Dookie. Honestly, it was so bad I couldn't even bring myself to focus on it properly. But weirdly enough, the impact wasn’t as strong as last week's episode. Maybe I’m getting used to the nonsense. Or maybe I’ve just stopped expecting anything.</p> 
<p>It’s not even worth criticizing in detail anymore. It’s so dumb it kind of loops around and becomes oddly entertaining. I can’t even say I’m watching it seriously at this point—but I’m still watching. So I guess that says something?</p>
<p>Anyway, I plan to keep “enjoying” this mess for what it is. It’s ridiculous. It's awful. But in a strange way, it’s become part of my week. Let’s see how far this disaster can go.</p>

<p>All in all, many titles still seem to be warming up. This season might be one where we need patience—to enjoy what shines, but also to make smart decisions about what to drop along the way.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>That wraps up our Week 1 overview for the Summer 2025 season.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, this season is shaping up to be a bit underwhelming so far—but we’ve only just opened the lid, and what’s inside remains a mystery. No one can predict how things will unfold from here, so instead of jumping to conclusions, let’s stay curious and look forward to what’s ahead.</p>

<p>Starting next week, we may see new titles enter the rankings, or unexpected shifts shake things up. The season has only just begun, and there's still so much that could happen. In short—don’t blink.</p>

<p>As of now, 28 titles were initially selected for the main phase. This week, however, we said goodbye to two of them: <strong>Shy Hero & Assassin Princess</strong> (<em>Kizetsu Yuusha to Ansatsu Hime</em>) and <strong>Dear Rain: The Mikado Sisters – Ease the Breeze</strong> (<em>Mikado no Sanshimai wa Angai Choroi</em>). With those two dropped, we’re moving forward with 26 titles in Week 2.</p>

<p>Let’s see where this goes. Hope you’ll continue to follow the Summer 2025 Weekly Rankings with me—see you next week!</p>
