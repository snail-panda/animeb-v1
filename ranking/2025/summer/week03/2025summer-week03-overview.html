    <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
     <p>Here we are in Week 3 of the Summer 2025 anime rankings.</p>
<p>While there haven’t been any major plot developments across the board, there’s been a fair amount of movement within the rankings.</p>
<p>Some shows are still struggling to leave a strong impression, but a few others managed to shine this week with standout episodes.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s dive right into the rankings and see how things played out.</p>

  <section class="overview-highlights">
    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
   <p>Now that the <strong>Week 1</strong> main round has begun, let me first briefly explain the difference between this and the prelim phase.</p>

<p>In the prelim, I checked out 45 titles by watching their first or second episodes, then trimmed the list down to under 30 for the main round—specifically, 28 this time.<br>
The evaluation criteria I used remain basically the same here in the main phase.</p>


<p>The only major difference is that the prelim was based on premiere episodes, whereas Week 1 is evaluated based on the episodes that actually aired this week.</p>

<p>As for this week’s highlights, the clear standout was <strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>). No doubt, this is shaping up to be one of the flagship shows of the season.</p>

<p><strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>) continues to shine. It’s a carryover from the previous season, but the familiar worldbuilding and steady quality keep it firmly in the spotlight.</p>

<p><strong>CITY THE ANIMATION</strong> (<em>CITY THE ANIMATION</em>)—regardless of how you rate its structure—left a strong impression thanks to its sharp execution and sheer creative energy.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Stone: Science Future</strong> (<em>Dr. Stone: Science Future 4th Season 2nd Cour</em>) was already mentioned in the prelim, but while its peak might have been in earlier seasons, the current arc still bursts with energy and passion. This week’s episode was no exception.</p>

<p><strong>#5: April Showers Bring May Flowers</strong> (<em>Busu ni Hanataba wo.</em>) wasn’t particularly outstanding, to be honest. Still, Episode 2 had a certain charm. Its attention to character dynamics and atmosphere was quite nice.<br>
The bowling scene and the birthday dinner with her family at the okonomiyaki place were especially well done.</p>

<p>I’ll keep the spotlight section short here, since much of it overlaps with what I already discussed during the prelim.</p>

<p><strong>Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</strong> (<em>Dekin no Mogura</em>) personally struck a chord with me. I didn’t click with the creator’s previous work, but this one feels different and intriguing.</p>

<p><strong>See You Tomorrow at the Food Court</strong> (<em>Food Court de, Mata Ashita</em>) was a pleasant surprise. I usually shy away from shows that revolve entirely around conversations between high school girls in static settings, but this one really worked for me. The witty script by <strong>Jukki Hanada</strong> shines throughout, with sharp character work, great dialogue, and clever pacing. While it may seem like a collection of short vignettes at first glance, the episodes are subtly interconnected in a satisfying way. It’s a low-key gem that succeeds by doing the simple things exceptionally well.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Exchange With a Game Centre Girl</strong> (<em>GaCen Shoujo to Ibunka Kouryuu</em>) was... honestly, a mess. The setup is thin, the romantic arc feels forced, and most egregiously, the English-language element—arguably the show’s main hook—falls completely flat. The protagonist is supposed to be a British girl, but the voice acting doesn’t reflect that at all. While the voice actress may be a native American English speaker, her accent leans American—and even that doesn’t sound quite natural. In 2025, when exposure to English-speaking cultures is far from rare in Japan, the show’s approach to cross-cultural interaction feels stuck in the past. Shallow, outdated, and tonally confused—it’s a big disappointment.</p>



<p>All in all, many titles still seem to be warming up. This season might be one where we need patience—to enjoy what shines, but also to make smart decisions about what to drop along the way.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>That wraps up our Week 1 overview for the Summer 2025 season.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, this season is shaping up to be a bit underwhelming so far—but we’ve only just opened the lid, and what’s inside remains a mystery. No one can predict how things will unfold from here, so instead of jumping to conclusions, let’s stay curious and look forward to what’s ahead.</p>

<p>Starting next week, we may see new titles enter the rankings, or unexpected shifts shake things up. The season has only just begun, and there's still so much that could happen. In short—don’t blink.</p>

<p>As of now, 28 titles were initially selected for the main phase. This week, however, we said goodbye to two of them: <strong>Shy Hero & Assassin Princess</strong> (<em>Kizetsu Yuusha to Ansatsu Hime</em>) and <strong>Dear Rain: The Mikado Sisters – Ease the Breeze</strong> (<em>Mikado no Sanshimai wa Angai Choroi</em>). With those two dropped, we’re moving forward with 26 titles in Week 2.</p>

<p>Let’s see where this goes. Hope you’ll continue to follow the Summer 2025 Weekly Rankings with me—see you next week!</p>
