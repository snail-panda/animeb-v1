    <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
    <p>With Week <strong>7</strong> now upon us, the Summer 2025 anime season has fully entered its back half.</p>

<p>As I mentioned last week, the season’s two “twin pillars” already wrapped up their runs, so I went into Week 7 with a touch of worry about how the rest would shake out. In the end, a few moves I’d anticipated did happen—and in several ways, the picture became clearer.</p>

<p>Traditionally, Week 7 often felt like a hand-off into the late game—sometimes even the classic “beach breather” week. So how did things actually play out this time? Let’s take a look.</p>

      <h5>**Notice**</h5>
      <p>Nothing special to note this week. If anything, the broadcast time for <strong>Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus</strong> (<em>Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai</em>) was slightly delayed and briefly in doubt, but it managed to make it into this week just in time.</p>
      <p>As usual, for detailed (or sometimes broad) impressions on the five ranked works and the three Spotlight/Pickup works, please check the review via the <strong>Review</strong> button in the ranking table. Now, let’s look back at this week’s rankings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <br>
      <p>This week, only one title in the Top 5 overlapped with last week—major shake-ups, which is both exciting and very welcome.</p>

      <h4>Top 5 (Ranked Works)</h4>
      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li>
          <p><strong><big>1st Dr. Stone: Science Future Part 2</strong></big> (<em>Dr. Stone: Science Future 4th Season 2nd Cour</em>)</p>
      <p>It wasn’t just wild—it was downright outrageous at times, in the best way. The sheer energy was overwhelming, and they packed so much into 23 minutes that it was genuinely thrilling. Every character shone, and as a whole—animation, structure, direction, and the BGM/music—everything was truly wonderful. Senku’s leadership, Chrome’s flashes of insight, Xeno’s devotion to science and elegance, and even the passion of the team making diamonds far away in California—all of it was fantastic.</p></br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong><big>2nd Me and the Alien MuMu</big></strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>)</p>
      <p>Both parts A and B were impeccable. Part A’s nursery-school volunteer visit landed punchline after punchline, and the final “Aren’t we literally being used as a plot device?” jab from the girls hit perfectly right after the piglet story. As for Part B, the “Kyoko, 30 years old” bait-and-switch leading into the section chief’s tear-jerker was classic, but executed with such skill—tying in the history and evolution of tape media—that it was outstanding. The twist that Mom is actually fine (contrary to everyone’s assumptions), the section chief’s kindness and motivation, and the warmth seen in his interactions with Komatsu—there’s nothing more to say; it was a wonderful, wonderful episode.</p></br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong><big>3rd Sword of the Demon Hunter</big></strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>)</p>
      <p>The passage of time can be joyous, lonely, and even cruel. This episode gently and deeply soaked in those complex feelings. It’s impossible to sum up in a sentence. The growth of the girl Jinya takes in, the soba shop owner, the playful Akitsu Somegorou, and Miura Naotsugu—who has become a close friend to Jinya—the way the show depicts their relationships and the flow of years is superb. The antique-shop scene with the tea set painted with hydrangeas, and the parting that follows—so much is packed in. Much like a gem—speaking of which, not <strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>), but still—this episode itself felt like a jewel. It was wonderful.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong><big>4th See You Tomorrow at the Food Court</big></strong> (<em>Food Court de, Mata Ashita</em>)</strong></p>
      <p>Before it aired—and even right after it began—I never imagined I’d come to love this show so much or that it would become so important to me. It’s literally just two high-school girls chatting at a mall food court. That’s it. Yet with every episode I grew fonder of them, and the time spent with those two at the food court became precious. The moments, thoughts, and experiences they share made me feel like I was there with them; with each episode, that shared time became something truly special. Episode 5—the de facto finale—was phenomenal, and Episode 6 felt like the gentle return from time shared with us back to the girls’ own everyday life at the food court. <strong><em>Hanada Jukki</em></strong>’s tightly crafted script and direction were superb. If you’ve put it off due to preconceptions—“I haven’t watched it,” or “I tried Ep.1 and dropped it”—please give it a real shot. Even just to Episode 2 should make it clear this is not merely idle chatter between girls. I’ve written about it in multiple places—on this ranking page’s reviews and on the mid-season recommendations—so please check those too. It’s a marvelous series.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong><big>5th Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</big></strong> (<em>Dekin no Mogura</em>)</p>
      <p>It still has a strong, quirky flavor that may divide viewers, but I suspect it will resonate with more people than you’d think—so long as they actually watch it. Yes, it has a unique rhythm and momentum, but what it’s doing and saying isn’t melodrama built by over-direction; it’s more grounded and life-sized. People really do get hung up on trivial things, and those tiny snags can warp relationships in all sorts of ways—that’s portrayed at the exact scale it deserves. Mogura’s words also hit straight and true; they really land. That’s the show’s charm—it’s interesting and never boring. Both A and B parts were great this week. Part A covered the all-too-common “insensitive older guy,” who casually says hurtful things and wounds those around him, especially kids and teenage girls. The episode made a point about forgiveness: he regrets it; it’s not something to kill over; and sometimes the person hurt is stronger than you think. Part B focused on a family of cat exorcists; the delightfully off-the-wall mom, Kyoko (voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki), was a riot, and I’m even more excited for what’s next.</p><br>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Those are my quick impressions on the Top 5 ranked works. Let’s move on to notable works outside the rankings.</p><br>

      <h4>Spotlight</h4>
      <p><strong>The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity</strong> (<em>Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku</em>)</p>
      <p> Overblown tear-jerking contrivances and heavy-handed drama—CloverWorks at its most CloverWorks. But because they went all-in, and because the episode truly paid off things they’ve been building up, it worked. The way it depicted male friendship—fighting over dumb things, failing to be honest—was good precisely because those conflicts only happen when you do value each other. Yes, the timing of events was awfully convenient, random delinquents popped up right when needed, and someone who doesn’t look like a fighter was absurdly strong—but the positives outweighed those quibbles.</p><br>

      <h3>Editor’s Pick</h3>
      <p><strong>Turkey!</strong> (<em>Turkey!</em>)</p>
      <p>This is a love-it-or-hate-it title depending on how you accept the wild twist at the end of Episode 1. I understand dropping it there, but it feels like such a waste. I’ve come to believe more and more with each episode that the story truly begins after “that,” and that the show <em>needs</em> it to exist. If you expected a straight “high-school girls bowling club” show (which was actually pretty good through the first half of Ep.1), I get why you’d be disappointed—but that’s also a viewer preconception at work. Yes, the sudden time-slip is outrageous. I suspected there had to be more—and there was. Despite how goofy it can look, the series carefully stacks what matters, episode by episode, and it hits home. There are still “oh come on…” moments—this week too: a rock conveniently the size of a bowling ball for knocking down samurai, etc.—but that’s not the point. What it wants to depict is people, womanhood, identity, perspective, and growth. Values differ by era, environment, and culture; they can be hard to understand—but each person is still a person, with a valid worldview, and we ourselves grow and change. Through a woman’s growth, the show explores how we learn there are things we simply have to accept, then choose and digest them in our own way. Bowling metaphors abound—curves, splits, strikes, the gutter—it’s corny, but it fits. And beyond that, the plotting is tighter than it looks, promising a lot to come. If you haven’t been watching, you’re missing out. Even those who don’t usually like “girls goofing around” shows may enjoy this; I think it’s for everyone. This week was great again.</p><br>

      <h4>Dookie</h4>
      <p><strong>Rent-a-Girlfriend Season 4</strong> (<em>Kanojo, Okarishimasu 4th Season</em>)</p>
      <p> I’m done. Nothing has progressed since Season 1. How many years? How many volumes? Nothing. They made a movie. Grandma passed away. They still live next door. Zero progress. And now what? A big group trip to a Hawaiian resort in Fukushima for no reason. Same beats: they ride a train—end. Mami shows up—shock—end. Same room as Mizuhara—heart-pounding—end. Everything always circles back to Mizuhara: “She’s so cute, so cute; someone like me… but I’ll confess! What if the rental-girlfriend thing is exposed? Ruka’s mad! Mami’s nonsense!” I genuinely don’t care anymore. It’s rotted from inaction. Keep doing it forever if you want.</p>

      <p>Those were the three notable out-of-ranking works this week. With 22 shows still under evaluation, overall quality was very high, and the competition up to around ranks 12–13 was fierce. Here’s a quick rundown of ranks 6 and below:</p><br>

      <h4>Ranks 6 and Below</h4>
      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">

        <li>7th: <strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>)</li>
        <li>8th: <strong>Turkey!</strong> (<em>Turkey!</em>)</li>

        <li>10th: <strong>CITY THE ANIMATION</strong> (<em>CITY THE ANIMATION</em>)</li>
        <li>11th: <strong>Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>)</li>

        <li>13th: <strong>April Showers Bring May Flowers</strong> (<em>Busu ni Hanataba wo.</em>)</li>
        <li>14th: <strong>The Summer Hikaru Died</strong> (<em>Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu</em>)</li>
        <li>15th: <strong>Clevatess</strong> (<em>Clevatess: Majuu no Ou to Akago to Kabane no Yuusha</em>)</li>
        <li>16th: <strong>Dan Da Dan Season 2</strong> (<em>Dan Da Dan 2nd Season</em>)</li>

        <li>19th: <strong>Rent-a-Girlfriend Season 4</strong> (<em>Kanojo, Okarishimasu 4th Season</em>)</li>
        <li>20th: <strong>Hotel Inhumans</strong> (<em>Hotel Inhumans</em>)</li>
        <li>21st: <strong>Welcome to the Outcast's Restaurant!</strong> (<em>Tsuihou  Shokudou e Youkoso!</em>)</li>
        <li>22nd (last): <strong>Secrets of the Silent Witch</strong> (<em>Silent Witch: Chinmoku no Majo no Kakushigoto</em>)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Quick Comments (titles not covered above)</h4>
      <p>This week there’s nothing in particular I want to add.</p>
      <p>Oh, one thing: the 22nd-place (last) <strong>Secrets of the Silent Witch</strong> (<em>Silent Witch: Chinmoku no Majo no Kakushigoto</em>) scored a 4 this week. It’s frankly painful to watch, and no matter where the plot goes from here I don’t think I’ll be able to care, so I may perform a literal “silent witch” drop next week.</p><br>
    </section>

    <h4>Viewing Status</h4>
<p>This week had <strong>two drops</strong> and <strong>zero additions</strong> —
<strong>Grand Blue Dreaming Season 2</strong> (<em>Grand Blue 2nd Season</em>) and 
<strong>Secrets of the Silent Witch</strong> (<em>Silent Witch: Chinmoku no Majo no Kakushigoto</em>).
The latter was so rough I didn’t even bother scoring it. Our tally goes from 22 down to <strong>20</strong>.</p>

<p>From here, the back half usually puts watchlists on a diet — if a show won’t move, it gets cut. 
That’s the seasonal ritual at this point… call it the natural order of things.</p>

  </section>

  <section class="overview-conclusion">
    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>That wraps up the summary for Week 7 of the Summer 2025 season.</p>

<p>Next up is <strong>Week 8</strong>, when the late-season surge either kicks into gear or the slow burners have to finally move or risk stalling out. I’m quietly expecting more activity across the board—and maybe a few surprises.</p>

<p>As predicted last week, <strong>two shows bowed out</strong> this week. As the ranking table suggests, the landscape is crystallizing into three groups: the genuinely excellent, the “good but missing one gear,” and the “what are you even trying to do?” duds. I expect the watchlist to keep trimming from here.</p>

<p>If there’s a title you’re keeping an eye on—or an episode that really landed for you—drop a comment and tell me what hit.</p>

<p>See you again next week!</p>
