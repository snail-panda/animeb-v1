    <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
    <p>With Week <strong>7</strong> now upon us, the Summer 2025 anime season has fully entered its back half.</p>

<p>As I mentioned last week, the season’s <strong>two big hitters</strong> — Takopi’s Original Sin (<em>Takopii no Genzai</em>) and See You Tomorrow at the Food Court (<em>Food Court de, Mata Ashita</em>) — have already wrapped up their runs, so I went into Week 7 <strong>wondering how the rest would turn out</strong>. In the end, a few moves I’d anticipated did happen — and in several ways, <strong>things started to come into focus</strong>.</p>

<p>Back in the day, Week 7 often doubled as a soft hand-off into the second half — sometimes even the classic <strong>“beach episode”</strong>: the kind of lighthearted detour where the story takes a back seat and the girls show up in swimsuits, maybe do the obligatory watermelon-splitting, and basically just goof around for fanservice. So how did things actually play out this time? Let’s take a look.</p>


<p>Traditionally, Week 7 often felt like a hand-off into the late game—sometimes even the classic “beach breather” week. So how did things actually play out this time? Let’s take a look.</p>

      <h5>**Notice**</h5>
      <p>Nothing out of the ordinary this week. If anything, there was a small shift in the <strong>number of tracked titles</strong>.(See “Viewing Status” at the end for details.)</p>
      <p>As usual, for detailed (or sometimes broad-strokes) impressions on the five ranked works and the three Spotlight/Pickup works, please check the review via the <strong>Review</strong> button in the ranking table. Now, let’s look back at this week’s rankings.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <br>
      <p>We opened with an 11-point first place, had two 10s on the board, and the top four were flat-out gripping—big, moving episodes that pulled me right in. In short, Week 7 (at least at the top) was a high-level, joy-to-watch kind of week.</p>

      <h4>Top 5 (Ranked Works)</h4>
      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li>
    <p><strong><big>1st Ruri Rocks</big></strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>)</p>
    <p>Overwhelming—in the best way. A jewel of a 23-minute short film stuffed with things that matter. I go long in the ranking review, but the core is simple: the moment Shōko labels what she’d called “worthless trash” as “Ruri Glass” and gently tucks it away—everything lands. Everyone shines here: the episode puts a quiet spotlight on Imari<sup>※1</sup>, the new character <em>Shōko</em> steps in to open a new lane, Ruri’s first-encounter beat is elegant, and Nagi, of course, steals a few scenes like it’s nothing. Imari’s different angle on mineralogy pops, which is why Shōko can finally speak honestly to her. And yes, even the parents’ offhand wound gets paid off properly.</p>

   <p class="footnote">※1 Metaphor: like a gem (incl. a glass)—depending on the viewer’s angle, different facets catch the light, so it seems to shine differently.</p>

    <p>At first you go, “Wait, what?”—but the final beat is sly and kind: parents, for all their clumsiness, mostly want their kid’s happiness. That “karaage at the dinner table” scene shows it without underlining, and it hit me hard. (Naturally, I had karaage right after.) Episode 7 of <strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> was wonderful.</p><br>
  </li>
        <li>
    <p><strong><big>2nd Sword of the Demon Hunter</big></strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>)</p>
    <p>Details in the ranking review; here I’ll take a different angle. If there’s a theme, it’s “parting”—or maybe “setting off.” The soba-shop master accepts his time and leaves words for Jinya and O-fū—who must live long, as oni now—that thud in your chest not because the lines are fancy, but because his life has been drawn so plainly and well that the man himself speaks louder than any dialogue. Jinya and O-fū listen in full; even the little one listens in her own way. It’s moved with restraint—no melodrama, no prestige-TV bombast—yet it cuts deep. That level of direction is rare lately, and this show is top-tier at it.</p>
    <p>Then the second half twists the knife: Jinya reveals his oni form to save his friend on the road to Kyoto, risking the same recoil we once saw with his (not blood-related) younger sister. He disappears right after—can that bond be mended next time? And maybe, one day, with the sister too. (As for showing his oni form to his daughter—my read: that’ll be okay.)</p><br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong><big>3rd Turkey!</big></strong> (<em>Turkey!</em>)</p>
    <p>Full thoughts in the review. This week centers the purple-haired glasses girl—the butterfly-effect worrier—and her brush with a traveling performer who likely is the father, plus Natsume, likely the ancestor. The three form a quiet triangle whose values rhyme across time. Until now, “Sengoku rules are Sengoku rules” sat apart from modern thinking; Natsume’s stance is pointedly contemporary: people differ, full stop; don’t stuff them into presets.</p>
    <p>Also loved the line: just like water, “air” is necessary to live. Dad left to give people “water.” She tried to be “air,” too afraid to touch anything. When she accepts his way, she finally takes a step—doing a completely different kind of “bowling” to bring “water” to this land. These crossings feel inevitable—as if past and future co-shape each other—so maybe you can’t actually “break” the future; maybe you grow into it. If you bounced at Ep.1 or 2, come back. You’re missing out.</p><br>
  </li>
        <li>
    <p><strong><big>4th Dr. Stone: Science Future Part 2</big></strong> (<em>Dr. Stone: Science Future 4th Season 2nd Cour</em>)</p>
    <p>Same as the Top 3: see the review for the full gush. Short version: packed to the rafters. The “oh come on” moments are plentiful—and perfectly fine—because the fun and heat blow the doors off. Honestly, the absurd bits feel required to keep up with that heat. Sure, “When did they make all those tools?” “How’d they scale that cliff?”—a billion questions. Doesn’t matter.</p>
    <p>What matters: everyone is alive on screen. Senku’s leadership and flashes, Chrome’s flexible thinking, even the far-off allies and the “enemy” side—every one of them feels like a lead. The showdown with Stanley and what comes after—can’t wait.</p><br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong><big>5th April Showers Bring May Flowers</big></strong> (<em>Busu ni Hanataba wo.</em>)</p>
    <p>Is it leagues above ranks 6–9? No. But the things this show has been steadily building since Episode 1 are finally taking shape, and that lift in character/story appeal nudged it ahead—barely, but enough to hit me a bit harder this week.</p>
    <p>Exhibit A: the younger Ueno brother and Tabata’s delicate push-pull. He wants to act grown, but because he cares, he insists on only what he can do himself—that straightness lands with Tabata, and the older Ueno’s unadorned smile when someone simply remembers his birthday is exactly right. The smooth operator Uguisudani and everyone else? Also clumsy, in their own ways. Doing the simple-but-hard thing is hard for everyone. For whatever reason, this week I was knocked over by that plain, honest charm.</p>
    <p>Side note: I share the exact same birthday as the older Ueno—August 16. Summer break, peak Obon: no club, friends out of town—most years no one even realized it was my birthday. So “I’m just happy you remembered” hits home. In high school we even formed an August-born club for a joint birthday—everyone jumped at it for… obvious reasons.</p><br>
  </li>
</ul>

      <p>Those are the quick takes on the Top 5. Normally we’d move to notable out-of-ranking titles—but this week, in a good way, there wasn’t a “gotta-spotlight-this” winner. So the three that follow—“Spotlight,” “Editor’s Pick,” and “Dookie”—are all, well… dookie. And since I’ve already said my piece in the ranking reviews, I’m keeping these to one-liners.</p><br>

      <h4>Spotlight</h4>
      <p><strong>Hotel Inhumans</strong> (<em>Hotel Inhumans</em>)</p>
<p>Nonsensical and full of cracks. At this rate it’s on the verge of a second drop…</p>
<p><small>*For details, check the review in the ranking table.</small></p>
<br>

      <h3>Editor’s Pick</h3>
      <p><strong>Clevatess</strong> (<em>Clevatess: Majuu no Ou to Akago to Kabane no Yuusha</em>)</p>
<p>All flash (plot beats, forceful art, visceral impact), not enough substance. Too many head-scratchers; honestly, it’s rough.</p>
<p><small>*For details, check the review in the ranking table.</small></p>
<br>

      <h4>Dookie</h4>
      <p><strong>Rent-a-Girlfriend Season 4</strong> (<em>Kanojo, Okarishimasu 4th Season</em>)</p>
<p>I keep saying the same thing every week: <em>please progress already</em>. At this point it makes not just Mami and Ruka but basically everyone look unhinged.</p>
<p><small>*For details, check the review in the ranking table.</small></p>
<br>

      <p>Those are this week’s three “pickups” outside the Top 5. As of now I’m still tracking <strong>22 titles</strong>, overall quality at the top was high, and up through about ninth place the gap was razor-thin (the gap between 5th and 6th was a mere <strong>0.05</strong>). In other words, any of them could’ve been fifth. Next is a quick rundown of ranks 6 and below.</p><br>

      <h4>Ranks 6 and Below</h4>
      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
        <li>6th: <strong>Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>)</li>
  <li>7th: <strong>Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</strong> (<em>Dekin no Mogura</em>)</li>
  <li>8th: <strong>Solo Camping for Two</strong> (<em>Futari Solo Camp</em>)</li>
  <li>9th: <strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>)</li>
  <li>10th: <strong>My Dress-Up Darling Season 2</strong> (<em>Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2</em>)</li>
  <li>11th: <strong>CITY THE ANIMATION</strong> (<em>CITY THE ANIMATION</em>)</li>
  <li>12th: <strong>Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus</strong> (<em>Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai</em>)</li>
  <li>13th: <strong>Welcome to the Outcast's Restaurant!</strong> (<em>Tsuihou Shokudou e Youkoso!</em>)</li>
  <li>14th: <strong>The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity</strong> (<em>Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku</em>)</li>
  <li>15th: <strong>The Summer Hikaru Died</strong> (<em>Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu</em>)</li>
  <li>16th: <strong>Dan Da Dan Season 2</strong> (<em>Dan Da Dan 2nd Season</em>)</li>
  <li>17th: <strong>Grand Blue Dreaming Season 2</strong> (<em>Grand Blue 2nd Season</em>)</li>
  <li>18th: <strong>Hotel Inhumans</strong> (<em>Hotel Inhumans</em>)</li>
  <li>19th: <strong>Clevatess</strong> (<em>Clevatess: Majuu no Ou to Akago to Kabane no Yuusha</em>)</li>
  <li>20th (last): <strong>Rent-a-Girlfriend Season 4</strong> (<em>Kanojo, Okarishimasu 4th Season</em>)</li>

      <h4>Quick Comments (titles not covered in the Top 5 & 3 Pickups)</h4>
      
      <p>As noted above, the gap between 5th and 9th this week was razor-thin—mostly a matter of subjective impression. Honestly, any of them could have sneaked into 5th. We’re talking about a spread of roughly 0.05–0.7 points. With that in mind, here are very short notes on the 6th–9th titles, just to add a bit of color on why they landed where they did.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>) – It carried a Season 1 vibe I really liked. Was I seriously the only person who didn’t realize Kyoko = Anko until now? If so, maybe I got to enjoy that reveal more than most (silver lining). The father-and-lighter thread—“precious human keepsakes are vampire weak points”—was a decent payoff, but the episode as a whole felt thin. A shaky family situation flipping straight into a decision about vampirization needs more groundwork; otherwise both sides read like whiplash. And even with the lighter, I still don’t buy how an ordinary high-schooler defeats her vampire dad. This arc would’ve benefited from more runtime.</p>

<p><strong>Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</strong> (<em>Dekin no Mogura</em>) – The cat-exorcist family was fun, and the “it’s not fate, it’s you” message landed. Mom Kyoko is delightfully unhinged, Dad’s good too, and the balance of “Mogura shows up vs. people solve their own stuff” remains spot on. Quietly weaving Mogura into people’s lives is exactly the charm. Still very excited for where it goes.</p>

<p><strong>Solo Camping for Two</strong> (<em>Futari Solo Camp</em>) – Very much my flavor in structure and direction: glancing back at the past, holding a faintly bittersweet memory up to the light, then measuring it against the present. There’s a whiff of narcissism in that self-regard, which actually fits. With the aspiring-actress ex popping up, it looks poised to move—curious to see how.</p>

<p><strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>) – The craft is rock solid and often brilliant, but as a <em>season-wide</em> story something feels missing; it doesn’t feel like anything’s truly “moving.” I love the show, yet right now it plays more like a superb omnibus of moments. A very slow burn that accumulates charm over the long haul might be exactly the play here.</p>

<br>

<p>That about wraps up my quick notes on ranks 6–9. I don’t have anything in particular to add about the other titles this week.</p><br>

    <h4>Viewing Status</h4>
<p>    
This week has <strong>zero additions</strong>. I’ve queued up <strong>two drops</strong> for next week — 
<strong>Grand Blue Dreaming Season 2</strong> (<em>Grand Blue 2nd Season</em>) and 
<strong>Secrets of the Silent Witch</strong> (<em>Silent Witch: Chinmoku no Majo no Kakushigoto</em>). 
The latter was so rough I didn’t even bother scoring it. We’re still at 22 titles for now; starting next week, the tally drops to <strong>20</strong>.</p>

<p>From here, the back half usually puts watchlists on a diet — if a show won’t move, it gets cut. 
That’s the seasonal ritual at this point… call it the natural order of things.</p>

  </section>

  <section class="overview-conclusion">
    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>That wraps up the summary for Week 7 of the Summer 2025 season.</p>

<p>Next up is <strong>Week 8</strong>, when the late-season surge either kicks into gear or the slow burners have to finally move or risk stalling out. I’m quietly expecting more activity across the board—and maybe a few surprises.</p>

<p>As predicted last week, <strong>two shows bowed out</strong> this week. As the ranking table suggests, the landscape is crystallizing into three groups: the genuinely excellent, the “good but missing one gear,” and the “what are you even trying to do?” duds. I expect the watchlist to keep trimming from here.</p>

<p>If there’s a title you’re keeping an eye on—or an episode that really landed for you—drop a comment and tell me what hit.</p>

<p>See you again next week!</p>
