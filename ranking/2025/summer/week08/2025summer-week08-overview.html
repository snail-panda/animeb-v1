  <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
  <p>With <strong>Week 8</strong> of the Summer 2025 anime season now behind us, we're inching right up to the edge of the final stretch.</p>

  <p>Personally, I’ve felt that this cour as a whole has lacked cohesion—something hasn’t quite clicked across the season. That said, several individual shows have steadily progressed or pulled off meaningful shifts in story, with some delivering serious emotional highs. On the flip side, a few made me wonder: <em>“Are we really this close to the end?”</em> That disconnect might be why this year’s “summer anime” hasn’t felt all that unified.</p>

  <p>In any case—how did Week 8 actually go? Let’s take a look.</p>

  <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>

    <h5><strong>Notice</strong></h5>
    <p>Note that <strong>The Summer Hikaru Died</strong> (<em>Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu</em>) did <strong>not air</strong> this week. As a result, the number of titles actively ranked this week comes to <strong>18</strong>.</p>

    <p>As usual, more detailed impressions—some precise, others completely half-baked—can be found via the <strong>Review</strong> button in the ranking table for each of the Top 5 and the three “pickup” titles.</p>
  </section>

    <section>
      <p>This week, the 1st and 2nd place shows were flat-out outstanding—episodes so strong there’s no other word but “bravo.” The 3rd and 4th place picks were also excellent, though each fell just a step or two short. As for 5th, the margin over the rest was razor-thin, but the steady buildup across episodes and the cumulative goodwill tipped it into the rankings. Overall, it wasn’t the strongest week across the board, but the top-ranked titles more than made up for it.</p><br>

      <h4  class="section-top5">Top 5 (Ranked Works)</h4>
      <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
       <li>
  <p><strong><big>1st Sword of the Demon Hunter</big></strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>)</p>
  <p>For the full impressions, please check the review linked in the ranking table. What follows is a brief note on what left an impression.</p>

  <p>This episode picked up right where the last left off—and delivered the conclusion I’d been worried about with total grace. Every word and gesture from O-fū hit deep; resisting tears was impossible. And then there was Naotsugu Miura, whose heartfelt apology and unflinching admission of fault hit just as hard. As both a samurai and a longtime friend, his sincerity shook me to the core.</p>

  <p>More than anything, I felt that what truly moved not just O-fū but Jinya and Naotsugu alike was the presence of Sadanaga. Even in death, he continued to live in their hearts—and perhaps, it was he who truly saved Jinya’s soul. A magnificent episode through and through. I have no doubt next week’s will also strike home. Can’t wait.</p><br>
</li>

<li>
  <p><strong><big>2nd Dr. Stone: Science Future Part 2</big></strong> (<em>Dr. Stone: Science Future – 4th Season, 2nd Cour</em>)</p>
  <p>As with the 1st place pick, please check the full review in the ranking table for detailed thoughts. Here's a short take:</p>

  <p>The characters’ passions, beliefs, and their unwavering trust in each other were in full display—and above all, Tsukasa’s change of heart toward “science” was deeply moving. Once its greatest enemy, he now entrusts it with the future. That realization alone was stirring, and perhaps it’s because science, here, is the crystallized flame of human ambition.</p>

  <p>This cour feels different from earlier seasons, but it’s the most exciting the show’s felt in a while. Can’t wait to see how far it goes from here.</p><br>
</li>

<li>
  <p><strong><big>3rd The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity</big></strong> (<em>Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku</em>)</p>
  <p>Again, full review in the table. This is just the brief version.</p>

  <p>This episode was… unfair—in the best way. If you’re gonna bring out the mom, and in <em>that</em> kind of scene? Yeah, you’re gonna get tears. But it wasn’t just cheap sentimentality—the way her feelings were woven throughout the episode made it impossible not to give it high marks.</p>

  <p>Her dyed hair always felt off somehow—I even wondered early on if she was a former delinquent. But no. Her brown hair and piercings were an expression of love, and I felt embarrassed for assuming otherwise. And the moment Rintarou overhears his friends genuinely speaking well of him? Honestly—does it get more heartwarming than that? I didn’t stand a chance. The cake scene, too—sparkling, radiant, impossibly warm. Waterworks, again.</p>

  <p>Over-the-top? Yes. But expertly done. I can’t fault it.</p><br>
</li>

<li>
  <p><strong><big>4th Ruri Rocks</big></strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>)</p>
  <p>This episode nicely continued the thread from Ruri and Shōko’s first meeting, focusing on their joint summer research project. That story interwove with Nagi and Imari’s fieldwork, and once again explored the relationship between man-made and natural objects—an extension of earlier themes with glass. The details were thoughtful throughout.</p>

  <p>The bottles were beautiful—washed ashore or buried, they didn’t leave much of a negative impression. But this time we saw environmental pollution from abandoned factories, which left a more complicated feeling. And yet, even that kind of interference can lead to rare, stunning phenomena. Ruri’s line—“Most things can’t be judged by just ‘good’ or ‘bad’”—felt honest and essential. And the fact that it was Ruri who said it made it even better.</p>

  <p>Ruri and Shōko, once united as a duo (the “Ruri Glass” combo), gained new awareness and connections through their interactions with Nagi and Imari. It felt like a kind of chemical reaction—refined, enhanced, and luminous, like Zincite. Another fantastic episode.</p><br>
</li>

<li>
  <p><strong><big>5th April Showers Bring May Flowers</big></strong> (<em>Busu ni Hanataba wo.</em>)</p>
  <p>Hard to put into words—and maybe that’s the point. This show lives in the space between “just enough” and “almost not quite.” And honestly, that balance feels just right.</p>

  <p>There’s still the central question: “Why does Ueno like Tabata so much?” I’m guessing we’ll get a natural answer by the end—so for now, I’m content to just keep watching. Maybe I’m starting to like Tabata too.</p>

  <p>Surprisingly, I’ve also grown fond of the side characters. Uguisudani is conniving, almost transparently so, but still very human. And the transfer-student party girl—she’s not the usual narrative disruption, which is refreshing. Honestly, for a 5th place pick, this review sounds all over the place. But that’s the show. That slightly off-kilter vibe? I’m into it.</p><br>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
      <p>Those were the quick impressions on the Top 5 ranked titles. Now let’s turn to a few notable picks outside the rankings.</p>
<p>As with the Top 5, I’ve already gone into more detail in the reviews linked in the ranking table, so what follows here will stay at the quick-take level.</p><br>


      <h4 class="three-picks">Spotlight</h4>
<p><strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuMu</em>) — The highlight for me was early on: Miss Campus, the “Smiling Komachi,” dropping the line, “My charger is custom-made!” Perfect. All the buildup leading into that moment paid off, and Sonoko’s conflicted kindness clashing with Tenkuubashi’s unwavering love finally bore fruit. I even enjoyed the back half more than most, and honestly, it felt like it came within a hair of sneaking into the Top 5.</p>

<br>

<h4 class="three-picks">Editor’s Pick</h4>
<p><strong>My Dress-Up Darling Season 2</strong> (<em>Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2</em>)</p>
<p>For me, this week didn’t land. Objectively, there were some nice beats—① Amane catching Asahi’s unease and stepping out with him for a smoke; ② Juju-sama once again showing just how hopeless she is when it comes to her younger sister. But the conveniences piled up, CloverWorks’ heavy-handed direction still doesn’t mesh with me, and Marin’s fluttery romcom beats felt meaningless. At best? “Wow, the animation is gorgeous”—whether it’s a Donki interior or anything else. Beyond that, I was unmoved.</p>
<p><small>*See the review in the ranking table for details.</small></p>
<br>

<h4 class="three-picks">Dookie</h4>
<p><strong>Welcome to the Outcast's Restaurant!</strong> (<em>Tsuihou Shokudou e Youkoso!</em>)</p>
<p>(Speaking only for myself—harsh though it is.) Paper-thin and shallow. No real obstacles, everything just smooth sailing. The protagonist storms out on her own, but everyone’s kind and forgiving anyway. Personally? As long as Atelier’s cute, I don’t care—but as a show, there’s really nothing here.</p>
<p><small>*See the review in the ranking table for details.</small></p>
<br>

<p>Those are this week’s three pickups outside the Top 5. As I mentioned earlier, a couple of shows ranked below could easily have been 5th in a different week. Next up is a quick rundown of ranks 6 and below.</p><br>


      <h4>Ranks 6 and Below</h4>

      <h4>Quick Comments (titles not covered in the Top 5 & 3 Pickups)</h4>
      
      <p>As noted above, the gap between 5th and 9th this week was razor-thin—mostly a matter of subjective impression. Honestly, any of them could have sneaked into 5th. We’re talking about a spread of roughly 0.05–0.7 points. With that in mind, here are very short notes on the 6th–9th titles, just to add a bit of color on why they landed where they did.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>) – It carried a Season 1 vibe I really liked. Was I seriously the only person who didn’t realize Kyoko = Anko until now? If so, maybe I got to enjoy that reveal more than most (silver lining). The father-and-lighter thread—“precious human keepsakes are vampire weak points”—was a decent payoff, but the episode as a whole felt thin. A shaky family situation flipping straight into a decision about vampirization needs more groundwork; otherwise both sides read like whiplash. And even with the lighter, I still don’t buy how an ordinary high-schooler defeats her vampire dad. This arc would’ve benefited from more runtime.</p>

<p><strong>Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</strong> (<em>Dekin no Mogura</em>) – The cat-exorcist family was fun, and the “it’s not fate, it’s you” message landed. Mom Kyoko is delightfully unhinged, Dad’s good too, and the balance of “Mogura shows up vs. people solve their own stuff” remains spot on. Quietly weaving Mogura into people’s lives is exactly the charm. Still very excited for where it goes.</p>

<p><strong>Solo Camping for Two</strong> (<em>Futari Solo Camp</em>) – Very much my flavor in structure and direction: glancing back at the past, holding a faintly bittersweet memory up to the light, then measuring it against the present. There’s a whiff of narcissism in that self-regard, which actually fits. With the aspiring-actress ex popping up, it looks poised to move—curious to see how.</p>

<p><strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>) – The craft is rock solid and often brilliant, but as a <em>season-wide</em> story something feels missing; it doesn’t feel like anything’s truly “moving.” I love the show, yet right now it plays more like a superb omnibus of moments. A very slow burn that accumulates charm over the long haul might be exactly the play here.</p>

<br>

<p>That about wraps up my quick notes on ranks 6–9. I don’t have anything in particular to add about the other titles this week.</p><br>

    <h4>Viewing Status</h4>
<p>    
This week has <strong>zero additions</strong>. I’ve queued up <strong>two drops</strong> for next week — 
<strong>Grand Blue Dreaming Season 2</strong> (<em>Grand Blue 2nd Season</em>) and 
<strong>Secrets of the Silent Witch</strong> (<em>Silent Witch: Chinmoku no Majo no Kakushigoto</em>). 
The latter was so rough I didn’t even bother scoring it. We’re still at 22 titles for now; starting next week, the tally drops to <strong>20</strong>.</p>

<p>From here, the back half usually puts watchlists on a diet — if a show won’t move, it gets cut. 
That’s the seasonal ritual at this point… call it the natural order of things.</p><br>

  </section>

  <section class="overview-conclusion">
    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>That wraps up the summary for Week 7 of the Summer 2025 season.</p>

<p>Next up is <strong>Week 8</strong>, when the late-season surge either kicks into gear or the slow burners have to finally move or risk stalling out. I’m quietly expecting more activity across the board—and maybe a few surprises.</p>

<p>As predicted last week, <strong>two shows bowed out</strong> this week. As the ranking table suggests, the landscape is crystallizing into three groups: the genuinely excellent, the “good but missing one gear,” and the “what are you even trying to do?” duds. I expect the watchlist to keep trimming from here.</p>

<p>If there’s a title you’re keeping an eye on—or an episode that really landed for you—drop a comment and tell me what hit.</p>

<p>See you again next week!</p>
