    <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
      <p>
The 2025 Summer Season is finally here—and we’re kicking things off with a jam-packed <strong>Top 45 Prelim Ranking</strong> to get the excitement rolling.
</p>
<p>
I started by checking out nearly <strong>70</strong> titles—some closely, some just briefly—and from there, narrowed them down to <strong>45</strong> for this opening round.
</p>
<p>
It’s not quite the “main event” just yet. Consider this a transitional step: a pre-selection phase before the core weekly rankings truly begin. From next week on, the pool will be further refined to fewer than <strong>30</strong> titles, with consistent evaluation week by week.
</p>
<p>
So here it is—the <mark>Top 45</mark> Prelim Ranking. Which title made the strongest first impression? How did your favorites perform? Let's dive in.
</p>
<p><small>
*Although officially labeled as “Week 1,” this round functions as a preliminary selection phase based on early impressions—mostly from episodes 1 and 2. The true core lineup will be locked in from next week.

    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
  <p>
Just a <strong>heads-up</strong>: this ranking is based not only on the first episodes but on all that have already premiered, like episodes 1 and 2, since release dates vary by series.<br>  
When multiple episodes are available, I use the higher score among them.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, <strong>zero-or at most minimal prior info</strong> was used—just pure first impressions for <strong>a fair evaluation</strong>, at least I tried to keep it as unbiased as possible : how enjoyable it was, how promising it looked, how excited I am for what's to come.
</p>
  <p>Looking at the actual rankings, it’s clear that <strong>Summer 2025</strong> is shaping up to be an underwhelming season. Despite the sheer number of titles airing, truly standout shows—those that leave a lasting impact—were few and far between. That said, there were still some highlights worth mentioning.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> At the top of the list is <strong>Takopi's Original Sin</strong> (<em>Takopii no Genzai</em>), which was nothing short of shocking. With harrowing themes and unforgettable scenes, it's a show that made me question whether it should even be part of the rankings—it’s that intense. But in terms of impact and execution, it stood far above the rest.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Close behind was <strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>). Beyond its high production quality, it felt like a beautifully naive yet sincere journey, told through the chaotic innocence of Ruri herself. While her impulsive behavior may have annoyed some viewers, it seems clear this is the beginning of a transformation—a raw stone waiting to be polished. She <em>is</em> the gemstone of her own story.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>) continued to be delightful, with its cultural festival episode particularly touching. The show captures the weight of memories and the beauty of those that persist, even when they start to fade.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>CITY THE ANIMATION</strong> had truly impressive animation—no surprise given the staff—but whether it will be “entertaining” going forward is still up in the air. Visually, though, it was stunning.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Dr. Stone: Science Future Part 2</strong> (<em>Dr. Stone: Science Future 4th Season 2nd Cour</em>) felt like more of the same, though I couldn’t shake the feeling that Season 1 was the creative peak. Still, its mix of absurd science and heated passion was engaging in its own way.</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> Among new titles, <strong>Clevatess</strong> (<em>Clevatess: Majuu no Ou to Akago to Kabane no Yuusha</em>) left a strong impression with its intensity and visual flair. It feels like a dark horse with a lot of potential going forward.</p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> Meanwhile, <strong>April Showers Bring May Flowers</strong> (<em>Busu ni Hanataba wo.</em>) had a shaky start—nothing terrible, but far from promising. Here’s hoping it picks up.</p>

<p><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Dekin no Mogura</strong> (<em>Dekin no Mogura</em>) unexpectedly caught my attention. I didn’t care for the creator’s previous work, but this one felt oddly compelling. Despite my usual disinterest in occult-themed shows, this had something special in its opening.</p>

<p><strong>9.</strong> <strong>Fermat no Ryouri</strong> (<em>Fermat no Ryouri</em>) is absurd in the best way. It’s over-the-top, but in a landscape saturated with YouTube-savvy culinary realism, that level of passionate chaos might just be refreshing.</p>

<p><strong>10.</strong> <strong>My Dress-Up Darling Season 2</strong> (<em>Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2</em>) looked great, as expected—but it felt more like setup than payoff. Let’s see how it develops.</p>

<p><strong>11. Solo Camping for Two</strong> (<em>Futari Solo Camp</em>) is hard to read so far. It has that Morning magazine sensibility, which might work in its favor, but the heroine is a bit of a mess. Still, I’m hoping it settles into something enjoyable.</p>

<p><strong>12. Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>) didn’t feel like <strong>Call of the Night</strong> at all in its first episode. That said, the second half started to show promise, and the opening/ending themes are as great as ever.</p>

<p><strong>13. Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus</strong> (<em>Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai</em>) is one of those shows I don’t <em>want</em> to watch, yet I don’t regret it when I do. I still don’t enjoy the dynamic between the leads, but somehow the story manages to resonate by the end.</p>

<p><strong>14. Secrets of the Silent Witch</strong> (<em>Silent Witch: Chinmoku no Majo no Kakushigoto</em>) looks promising on the surface, with high production value. However, the extreme social anxiety of the lead character made it hard to watch. It could still turn out well, but it's a wait-and-see for me.</p>

<p><strong>15. Welcome to the Outcast’s Restaurant!</strong> (<em>Tsuihou Shokudou e Youkoso!</em>) follows the well-worn trope of the OP protagonist who gets kicked out and opens a food business. It’s all very predictable, but not entirely bad. Let’s see where it goes.</p>

<p><strong>16. Turkey!</strong> (<em>Turkey!</em>) might’ve lost people with its wild final twist, but the lead-up was surprisingly strong. If the show can embrace its absurdity fully, it might be a great “so dumb it’s fun” watch.</p>

<p><strong>17. Bad Girl</strong> (<em>Bad Girl</em>) looked decent but had little else to offer.</p>

<p><strong>18. See You Tomorrow at the Food Court</strong> (<em>Food Court de, Mata Ashita</em>) was unexpectedly interesting. Written by Jukki Hanada, the witty dialogue alone made it worth watching. Though it felt more like a comedy sketch than a traditional anime episode, I’m still intrigued.</p>

<p><strong>19. Rent-a-Girlfriend Season 4</strong> (<em>Kanojo, Okarishimasu 4th Season</em>) was… the same as always. Somehow, Kazuya's idiocy has become less offensive, which ironically makes the show feel less interesting. I still hope it finds new life.</p>

<p><strong>20. Dan Da Dan Season 2</strong> (<em>Dan Da Dan 2nd Season</em>) was all about brute force: quality, action, momentum. That works for some, but it’s wearing thin for me. It needs something <em>more</em> than just nonstop energy.</p>

<p><strong>21. Gachiakuta</strong> (<em>Gachiakuta</em>) didn’t leave much of an impression.</p>

<p><strong>22. Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show</strong> (<em>Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show</em>) started decently, but didn’t hold my attention for long.</p>

<p><strong>23. The Summer Hikaru Died</strong> (<em>Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu</em>) looked gorgeous, but emotionally it left me cold. I couldn’t connect to the characters or the setting—it felt like watching something from behind a glass wall.</p>

<p><strong>24. Uglymug, Epicfighter</strong> (<em>Busamen Gachi Fighter</em>) and <strong>25. Nyaight of the Living Cat</strong> (<em>Nyaight of the Living Cat</em>) were both passable, but I wouldn’t include them in the rankings. I’ll keep watching the cat one, though—because cats.</p>

<p><strong>26. Watari-kun’s ****** Is about to Collapse</strong> (<em>Watari-kun no xx ga Houkai Sunzen</em>) might turn out to be a decent dumb romcom. Or it might fall flat. We’ll see.</p>

<p><strong>27. Detectives These Days Are Crazy!</strong> (<em>Mattaku Saikin no Tantei to Kitara</em>) was outright bad. I honestly couldn’t sit through it.</p>

<p><strong>28. New Saga</strong> (<em>Tsuyokute New Saga</em>) felt like a long-delayed flop. Completely lifeless.</p>

<p><strong>29. The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity</strong> (<em>Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku</em>) gave off strong CloverWorks-trying-too-hard energy. It looked polished, but I couldn’t believe in any of it—neither the characters nor the feelings.</p>

<p><strong>30. Summer Pockets</strong> (<em>Summer Pockets</em>) technically aired, and I technically watched it.</p>

<p><strong>31. New PANTY & STOCKING with GARTERBELT</strong> was impressive visually, but I can’t say I cared much.</p>

<p><strong>32. Onmyo Kaiten Re:Birth Verse</strong> (<em>Onmyo Kaiten Re: verse</em>) was incomprehensible. Not offensively bad, just… who is this even for?</p>

<p><strong>33. Cultural Exchange With a Game Centre Girl</strong> (<em>GaCen Shoujo to Ibunka Kouryuu</em>) was well-produced but painfully shallow. I know there were complaints about the heroine speaking American English despite being British, but to me even the American accent felt off. The entire “cultural exchange” premise felt thin and rushed.</p>

<p><strong>34. The Shy Hero and the Assassin Princesses</strong> (<em>Kizetsu Yuusha to Ansatsu Hime</em>) was dumb, but maybe the girls will make it fun?</p>

<p><strong>35. Private Tutor to the Duke’s Daughter</strong> (<em>Koujo Denka no Katei Kyoushi</em>) is trashy wish fulfillment, but the girls are ridiculously cute. Maybe the cutest this season.</p>

<p><strong>36. Tougen Anki</strong> (<em>Tougen Anki</em>) was hot-blooded and ambitious but already felt exhausting. I’m out.</p>

<p><strong>37. Hotel Inhumans</strong> (<em>Hotel Inhumans</em>) had some interesting visuals but not much else. I’m tired of the “Hotel Something” trend, honestly.</p>

<p><strong>38. With You and the Rain</strong> (<em>Ame to Kimi to</em>) was stylish and beautifully animated, but the premise—communicating with a tanuki using a flipboard—just didn’t click with me.</p>

<p><strong>39. Dealing with Mikadono Sisters Is a Breeze</strong> (<em>Mikadono Sanshimai wa Angai, Choroi.</em>) was an absolute disaster. No charm in the visuals, no weight in the story—just a mess.</p>

<p><strong>40. The Water Magician</strong> (<em>Mizu Zokusei no Maho Tsukai</em>) had a strong start visually, but quickly fell into the typical OP-reincarnated magic-user cliché.</p>

<p><strong>41. Isekai Mokushiroku Mynoghra</strong> (<em>Isekai Mokushiroku Mynoghra: Hametsu no Bunmei de Hajimeru Sekai Seifuku</em>) had that trashy dark fantasy energy I usually enjoy, but something about it didn’t land. I’ll keep watching, but don’t expect much praise.</p>

<p><strong>42. There's No Freaking Way I'll Be Your Lover! Unless…</strong> (<em>Watashi ga Koibito ni Nareru Wake Naijan, Murimuri!</em>) lived up to its title: I couldn’t take it. Not for me.</p>

<p><strong>43. Grand Blue Dreaming Season 2</strong> (<em>Grand Blue 2nd Season</em>) was a major disappointment. Season 1 had dumb fun energy, but none of that came through in the new episode.</p>

<p><strong>44. Witch Watch</strong> (<em>Witch Watch</em>) was painfully weak. I barely made it through.</p>

<p><strong>45. A Couple of Cuckoos Season 2</strong> (<em>Kakkou no Iinazuke 2nd Season</em>) changed studios and lost all its charm. The character designs were off, and the chemistry was gone.</p>

<h3>Overall Impression</h3>

<p>As I said at the start, this season felt like a letdown. Despite dozens of new shows—including sequels that fans have waited years for—there wasn’t a single title that made me feel genuinely excited for what’s to come. The spark just wasn’t there.</p>

<p>Still, there were some bright spots:<br>
<strong>Takopi's Original Sin</strong>, <strong>Ruri Rocks</strong>, <strong>Clevatess</strong>, and maybe <strong>See You Tomorrow at the Food Court</strong>.<br>
And in the “dumb fun” corner: <strong>Dekin no Mogura</strong>, <strong>Fermat no Ryouri</strong>, and <strong>Turkey!</strong></p>

<p>It’s going to take a slow burn—or a major surprise—for Summer 2025 to turn things around. But for now, it’s been a sobering start.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>And with that, our preliminary Week 1 ranking for the <strong>Summer 2025 anime season</strong> comes to a close. This list reflects my honest, gut reactions based on the first episodes—or sometimes the second—for each show. In other words, this is just the opening stretch before the real season begins.</p>

<p>Summer 2025 already feels a bit different from past seasons. On one hand, the sheer number of titles airing is staggering. On the other, there’s a distinct sense of disappointment from the outset, with many shows underwhelming out of the gate. It’s a season that makes you wonder, “Is this going to be okay?”</p>

<p>That said, we’ve only just opened the lid. There’s still so much we don’t know, and part of the joy of following anime week by week is watching how things unfold—sometimes unexpectedly. It’s not just about watching the shows, but also about reflecting on how <em>we</em> watch them.</p>

<p>So let’s keep going together and see what Summer 2025 turns into. There’s still a lot to be excited about—or at least to be curious about. Thanks for reading, and I’ll see you again next week, when the main event really kicks off!</p>

<p>If you have any thoughts, reactions, or predictions of your own, feel free to share them. Let’s ride out the season together!</p>
