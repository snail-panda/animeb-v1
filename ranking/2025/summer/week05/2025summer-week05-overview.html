    <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
     <p>The Summer 2025 anime season has already entered its <strong>fifth week</strong>.</p>

<p>As we move into the middle of the season and approach the climax, many series—including some big-name titles—have been struggling to gain momentum since the start. One of the few works that had been carrying the early part of the season, <em>Takopi's Original Sin</em>, has now come to an end. I was wondering what direction things would take from here, but it seems this week’s rankings have seen quite a lot of movement.</p>

<p>So, what exactly happened? Let’s take a closer look.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
   <h4>**Notice**</h4>
<p>As mentioned last week, starting this week, <strong>Hotel Inhumans</strong> (<em>Hotel Inhumans</em>) will officially return to the main competition.</p>
<p>For detailed (or in some cases broad) impressions on the five ranked works and the three Spotlight/Pickup works, please check the review via the review button in the ranking table. Now, let’s look back at Week 5 through the rankings.</p><br>

<section>
  <p>As noted in the introduction, there were some major shifts in the rankings this week, which is a very welcome development.</p>

  <h4>Top 5 (Ranked Works)</h4>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>
      <p><strong>1st CITY THE ANIMATION</strong> (<em>CITY THE ANIMATION</em>): Kyoto Animation has created something truly remarkable. Whether it was actually “good” or not is beside the point—what we’re evaluating here is the fact that they built something overwhelmingly impressive.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>2nd My Dress-Up Darling Season 2</strong> (<em>Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2</em>): As with CloverWorks’ other works this season, it features overly high-quality animation push, melodramatic over-the-top directing, and underwhelming comedy or weak punchlines. Personally, I felt some contrivances and awkwardness, but these were far outweighed by some absolutely outstanding scenes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>3rd Turkey! Time to Strike</strong> (<em>Turkey!</em>): Since its first episode left many viewers dumbfounded, it seemed destined to barrel down its own (crappy) path. But starting last week, it’s shown a different side, and this week it delivered something truly good. The way it’s built up layers from early to mid-series was impressive, and I now expect it to regularly compete for a Top 5 spot.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>4th See You Tomorrow at the Food Court</strong> (<em>Food Court de, Mata Ashita</em>): From episode one, this has delivered sharp writing, structure, and direction as a surreal situational anime, and this week was no exception. The portrayal of Yamamoto and Wada’s friendship origin and their attitude toward it was truly moving. However, a minor personal gripe slightly lowered its rank.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>5th Hotel Inhumans</strong> (<em>Hotel Inhumans</em>): After dropping out of the main competition in Episode 2, Episodes 3 and 4 were both impressive. With Episode 5, this marks three strong episodes in a row, leading to its official reinstatement. While not necessarily fresh in content, its structure and presentation were very good. Personally, I also love the mysterious, enigmatic appeal of the female concierge.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Those are my quick impressions on the Top 5 ranked works. Let’s move on to notable works outside the rankings.</p><br>

  <h4 class="three-picks">Spotlight</h4>
  <p><strong>The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity</strong> (<em>Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku</em>): Like My Dress-Up Darling Season 2, this is a CloverWorks production, and it was… quite something. The sheer overload of contrivance and heavy-handed drama might leave you wondering, “What on earth am I watching?” But because they went all-in, the episode became something worth evaluating. Please savor this unnatural, overblown drama in all its glory.</p><br>

  <h4 class="three-picks">Editor’s Pick</h4>
  <p><strong>Solo Camping for Two</strong> (<em>Futari Solo Camp</em>): Early on, the heroine’s rudeness and lack of manners stood out, making many viewers uncomfortable. The animation also faltered, likely causing many to drop it. Over time, however, both improved. The previously unlikeable heroine Shizuku has grown on me, and the grumpy solo camper Gen has become more relatable. Akihito, Gen’s seemingly frivolous high school friend introduced last week, adds flavor to the series. This week’s parallel portrayal of Gen enjoying a solo camp and the heroine dining with others was also well done.</p><br>

  <h4 class="three-picks">“Crap” Pick</h4>
  <p><strong>Secrets of the Silent Witch</strong> (<em>Silent Witch: Chinmoku no Majo no Kakushigoto</em>): Frankly, it might have been better if she had just stayed silent and hidden. I’m embarrassed for having given it a decent early score back in Episode 1. My sympathies also go out to the theme song artist. This show is nothing but contrivances, abrupt developments, and lack of coherence—its strongest weapon is a “super cute heroine” who either pointlessly postures in critical moments or just lazes around otherwise. I thought the “crap” slot this season belonged to Turkey! Time to Strike, but this series easily stole the title.</p>

  <p>Those were the three notable out-of-ranking works this week. With 22 shows still under evaluation, the competition was fierce up to about rank 12 or 13. Here’s a quick rundown of ranks 6 and below:</p><br>

  <h4>Ranks 6 and Below</h4>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>6th: <strong>The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity</strong> (<em>Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku</em>)</li>
    <li>7th: <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>)</li>
    <li>8th: <strong>Solo Camping for Two</strong> (<em>Futari Solo Camp</em>)</li>
    <li>9th: <strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>)</li>
    <li>10th: <strong>Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</strong> (<em>Dekin no Mogura</em>)</li>
    <li>11th: <strong>Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus</strong> (<em>Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai</em>)</li>
    <li>12th: <strong>April Showers Bring May Flowers</strong> (<em>Busu ni Hanataba wo.</em>)</li>
    <li>13th: <strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>)</li>
    <li>14th: <strong>Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>)</li>
    <li>15th: <strong>The Summer Hikaru Died</strong> (<em>Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu</em>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Quick Comments (for titles not covered above)</h4>
  <p><strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>): Still excellent and engaging. I hope it reaches a wide audience—please watch it.</p>
  <p><strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>): Once again, it was both good and enjoyable. Nagi’s passionate speech was moving, and Ruri’s sense of unease was well portrayed.</p>
  <p><strong>Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</strong> (<em>Dekin no Mogura</em>): Personally entertaining and enjoyable. The subplot involving the lesser panda’s younger brother was fun.</p>
  <p><strong>Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus</strong> (<em>Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai</em>): As I’ve said before, this series works best when judged after the mystery is resolved, but this week’s episode was solid even on its own. Akagi was irresistibly cute, and despite the usual minimalistic CloverWorks storytelling, I found it enjoyable.</p>
  <p><strong>April Showers Bring May Flowers</strong> (<em>Busu ni Hanataba wo.</em>): I almost picked this for the top three outside rankings. It’s not outstanding, but it’s an easy, relaxing watch. Worth checking out if you have time. My rating dipped slightly due to a small inconsistency in part C.</p>
  <p><strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>): As usual, fun to watch. Sakurako keeps getting more and more provocative, which is a concern—I hope she remembers her hometown and grandmother.</p>

  <h4>Call of the Night Season 2 (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>) <br><small>(This will be a bit long)</small></h4>
  <p>Season 1 was a personal favorite, so I feel a real sense of loss. The original charm came from its small, confined world: Kou’s apartment complex, his entry into the “night world” through Nazuna, and the limited but magical scope seen through their time together. Now, the series has expanded to include more vampires, their kin, vampire hunters, and a lot of goofy humor I never asked for. While some gags and depictions are amusing, the main charm isn’t there anymore. Kou himself feels less appealing this season, perhaps due to inevitable growth from the ticking clock of becoming a vampire—but it’s just not as engaging. I wish there were more of the classmate/childhood friend from his complex and more of the small-scale “night hanging out” the title suggests.</p>

  <p><strong>The Summer Hikaru Died</strong> (<em>Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu</em>): This week unusually focused on Hikaru, Arata, and their circle. Without solidly depicting the everyday side, the series’ horror and action aspects can’t land. This episode managed to do that better, though I still find the supernatural elements confusing and uninteresting.</p>

  <p>And that’s my overview up to rank 15. The rest don’t warrant much comment. As the season moves past the midpoint, my watchlist will likely shrink, but we’ll see how it goes.</p>
</section>

<p>For the record, this week saw <strong>zero drops</strong> and <strong>one new addition: Hotel Inhumans</strong> (<em>Hotel Inhumans</em>), which has been in the rankings since last week but officially joined this week.</p>



</section>

  <section class="overview-conclusion">
    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>That wraps up the summary for Week 5 of the Summer 2025 anime season.</p>

<p>With Week 6 coming up—the peak of the mid-season—I expect we’ll see even bigger shifts in the rankings. Some series that have coasted on the impact of their early episodes may start to lose steam, while others that have been steadily building up their momentum might suddenly come into full bloom. Shows that have been consistently delivering strong results could surge even further and dominate the competition. Watching each individual series while keeping an eye on the overall trends is, after all, one of the real pleasures of following anime week by week. In any case, the <strong>Summer 2025 Weekly Anime Rankings</strong> are only going to get more exciting, so I’ll see you again next week!</p>

<p>If there’s a series you’re keeping an eye on, or if you’ve seen an episode you thought was especially good, feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
