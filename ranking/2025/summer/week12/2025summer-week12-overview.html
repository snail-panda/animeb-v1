    <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The Summer 2025 anime season has finally come to an end—and with that, it's time to take a step back and look at the journey we’ve been on these past few months.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be honest, I didn’t have particularly high expectations going in. Sure, there were some anticipated sequels and a few buzz-worthy titles floating around, but nothing that made me feel like, “Yes, this is the one.” It felt like a season that would be... fine. Just fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started out sampling about 50 titles. After narrowing things down, I kicked things off seriously with 28 shows. And from there, as the weeks went by, the list gradually shrank. In the end, I wrapped up the season with 20 shows—a pretty solid and manageable number.
    </p>
    <p>
      And let me say—what a ride it was. Despite the low expectations, this season turned out to be surprisingly entertaining. A lot of unexpected hits, emotional moments, and unpredictable turns kept me fully engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were shows that exceeded expectations, some that fell flat, and plenty that landed somewhere in between. But taken altogether, this season had something special. It wasn’t just about standout masterpieces—it was about the entire experience, ups and downs included.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may sound a little like a conclusion already, but truly, Summer 2025 gave us a season full of surprises—good, bad, and everything in between. It started off quietly, but ended with a lot of emotions packed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with that, let’s take a closer look at the results. What stood out? What stayed with us? Join me as we walk through this season’s highlights.
    </p>

  <section class="overview-highlights">
    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
        <p>To put it simply, Summer 2025 turned out to be a truly unforgettable anime season. There was such a rich variety of shows—each leaving its own mark—that I can’t help but feel grateful. Among them, two titles stood far above the rest:<br>
      <strong>The Apothecary Diaries 2nd Season</strong> (<em>Kusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season</em>) and <strong>Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary 2</strong> (<em>Shoushimin Series 2nd Season</em>).<br>
Both were so overwhelmingly strong and consistently brilliant that they left me stunned week after week. Every episode was airtight—flawless even—and the way each show carried itself from start to finish without missing a beat was nothing short of masterful. I genuinely believe they represent the very best anime has to offer.</p>

<p>Close behind them were two incredible surprises:<br>
  <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>) and <strong>Apocalypse Hotel</strong>.<br>
Both were outstanding in ways I didn’t expect. <strong>Apocalypse Hotel</strong>, an original title, impressed me with its quality and character-driven storytelling. The "whiskey episode" and the almost silent performance by Hachio-san were highlights of the season.</p>

<p><strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>) constantly surprised me with its elegant approach and emotional resonance. While some pointed to the battle animation as a flaw, I found it more than sufficient. What really stood out was the poetic storytelling and the beautifully depicted connections across people and time. I'm truly looking forward to its continuation next cour.</p>

<p><strong>A Ninja and an Assassin Under One Roof</strong> (<em>Ninja to Koroshiya no Futarigurashi</em>) and <strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>) added further energy to the season. From their early episodes through the midsection, they brought fun, style, and emotional surprises. Though both dipped slightly toward the end, their contribution to the season’s vibrancy was undeniable. <strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (Uchuujin MuuMuu) in particular will continue next cour, and I’m excited to see where it goes.</p>

<p><strong>The Catcher in the Ballpark!</strong> (Ballpark de Tsukamaete!) was a complete dark horse. I’m not into baseball at all—in fact, I actively dislike it. But this anime won me over with its slow, deliberate pacing and deep, personal storytelling. Each character’s life gradually came into view as their paths crossed at the stadium, creating an incredibly warm and authentic experience.</p>

    <p><strong>Kowloon Generic Romance</strong> (<em>Kowloon Generic Romance</em>) carried a thick nostalgic mood, with a faint touch that hinted ever so slightly at the kind of gritty, saturated texture seen in Legendary <strong>Black Lagoon</strong>. It wasn’t a direct echo—just a subtle, passing flavor in the early episodes. Though I had high hopes, the season couldn't contain the manga’s full scope. The result was a middle section that felt rushed and a final stretch that failed to land emotionally. I really wish it had more room to breathe.</p>

<p><strong>From Old Country Bumpkin to Master Swordsman</strong> (<em>Katainaka no Ossan, Kensei ni Naru</em>) was divisive from the beginning. The early episodes felt disjointed, and the protagonist’s popularity among beautiful former students was a stretch. But the story improved significantly in the second half—especially with the Miu arc, which gave the show a surprising emotional backbone. The production quality even increased. If only it had been like that from the start.</p>

    <p><strong>Once Upon a Witch’s Death</strong> (<em>Aru Majo ga Shinu Made</em>) was… well, ridiculous. The premise involved collecting 1,000 tears to survive—but no one even tried. Everything was chaotic, overly sentimental, and nonsensical. The ending was especially baffling, with the main character walking off on a journey that made no emotional or narrative sense.</p>

<p><strong>Can a Boy-Girl Friendship Survive?</strong> (<em>Danjo no Yuujou wa Seiritsu suru? (Iya, Shinai!!)</em>) initially gave the impression it might be a sincere story disguised as a stereotypical low-grade rom-com.<br>
The protagonist’s quiet dedication to creating flower accessories hinted at something tender and heartfelt. I honestly thought this could be a surprisingly thoughtful romance hiding behind a silly title. But that illusion didn’t last long.</p>
<p>In reality, this show falls squarely into the realm of <em>kuso-anime</em>—cheap, low-tier productions that practically demand you shut off your brain just to get through them. It was painfully dumb, shallow, and crammed with cliché tropes and meaningless antics. Calling it “D-tier” would be generous. It became a textbook example of how not to write characters, relationships, or story.</p>

<p>And if that wasn’t enough, it ends with exactly what the title promised: a blunt declaration that, no, friendship between boys and girls doesn’t exist—at least not for the main characters. And that truth was painfully obvious from the very beginning. As a “punchline,” it wasn’t clever, emotional, or satisfying. It was just empty.</p>

<p>In short, this was <em>kuso-tier</em> anime from beginning to end—with no irony or fun to redeem it.</p>

<p>Of course, I can't forget <strong>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</strong> (<em>Kidou Senshi Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em>). As someone who loves Gundam but isn’t a hardcore otaku, this show felt chaotic, creative, and wildly fun. Despite some divisive elements, I found the animation, direction, and parodic flair exciting from beginning to end.</p>

<p>As for shows I dropped, I was busy this season and intentionally kept my watchlist small. Still, many titles just didn’t hold up. Some felt rushed, others lacked substance, and a few were outright unbearable. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Summer Pockets</li>
  <li>The Shiunji Family Children (<em>Shiunji-ke no Kodomotachi</em>)</li>
  <li>Witch Watch</li>
  <li>Your Forma</li>
  <li>LAZARUS</li>
  <li>Mono: Weekend Animation (Mono)</li>
  <li>Food for the Soul (<em>Hibi wa Sugiredo Meshi Umashi</em>)</li>
  <li>Zatsu Tabi: That's Journey</li>
  <li>Anne Shirley</li>
  <li>The Dinner Table Detective (<em>Nazotoki wa Dinner no Atode</em>)</li>
  <li>Please Put Them On, Takamine-san! (Haitekudasai, Takamine-san)</li>
  <li>The Mononoke Lecture Logs of Chuzenji-sensei (<em>Chuuzenji-sensei Mononoke Kougi Roku Sensei ga Nazo wo Toite Shimau kara.</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>…just to name a few.</p>

    <p>And yes, <strong>Uma Musume: Cinderella Grey</strong> (<em>Uma Musume: Cinderella Gray</em>), while massively popular and widely praised, simply didn’t work for me. I’m not saying it was outright bad—it clearly had ambition—but it felt underwhelming and poorly paced given the high expectations around it. For such a high-profile title with a rich setting, it delivered far less than it promised. Please bear with me—this one just didn’t click.</p>

<p>Among those, one more title deserves special mention:<br>
  <strong>Rock Is a Lady’s Modesty</strong> (<em>Rock wa Lady no tashinami Deshite</em>) started off with surprising potential. In the first two episodes, it briefly hinted at an intriguing dynamic: elegant young ladies attending an elite girls’ school while secretly being obsessed with rock music. The contrast between high-class manners and wild musical passion could’ve been genuinely entertaining. In fact, I found myself thinking that the rock angle wasn’t even necessary—the story of how these girls survive and rise in such a strict environment could’ve stood strong on its own.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the series quickly unraveled. What ruined it most for me was its excessive, almost compulsive use of crude language. The girls—supposedly refined students—repeatedly hurled vulgar insults and used abrasive speech that felt completely out of place, both narratively and emotionally. The idea that “rock equals edginess” was reduced to “let’s make them say horrible things for shock value,” which completely missed the mark.</p>

<p>And this isn’t just about girls using foul language. Even if male characters spoke like this, it would’ve still been unbearable. The language wasn’t bold or rebellious—it was just loud, nasty, and grating. On top of that, the plot itself had little substance. Whatever promising contrast the show introduced early on was quickly buried under cheap antics and empty provocation. Ultimately, it was a deeply disappointing and exhausting watch.</p>

<p>If I had to pick one under-the-radar title that kind of worked a bit surprisingly, it would be: <strong>I’m the Evil Lord of an Intergalactic Empire!</strong> (<em>Ore wa Seikan Kokka no Akutoku Ryoushu!</em>). It was dumb, sure—but dumb in the best way because it was really dumb. Great chemistry between the protagonist and the female AI companion, it was touching, plus tons of energy. It had heart.</p>

<p>All in all, this season was packed with excitement, surprises, frustration, and passion. I ended up loving Summer 2025 far more than I ever anticipated before it began. It’s one of those rare seasons that I’m genuinely sad to see end. Even though we had some misfires, they were part of what made this season so memorable. I hope this final ranking doesn’t just serve to distinguish the best and worst—but instead celebrates the chaotic, beautiful energy of the Spring 2025 anime season as a whole.</p>
