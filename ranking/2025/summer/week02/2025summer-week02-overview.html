    <p>After being completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of shows during the prelim round and Week 1, things have finally started to settle down a bit as we head into Week 2 of the Summer 2025 season. It feels like we’re hitting the reset button here—time to catch our breath and really dig in.</p>

    <p>As always, this season is packed with buzzworthy titles, both brand-new and returning series. So then, how did things shake out in Week 2? Let’s take a look.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
  <p>
    The Spring 2025 anime season has already entered its second week, and this round brought a noticeable shift. While many shows made bold first impressions last week, this time we’re seeing real movement. Some titles took confident steps forward, while others stayed quiet, moving at their own pace. A few even stumbled—or outright crashed—by episode two. It’s already shaping up to be quite the dynamic season.
  </p>
  <p>
    Leading the pack this week were <strong>Apocalypse Hotel</strong> and <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>). Apocalypse Hotel continues to astonish with its stunning production quality, expressive characters, and deeply thought-out details that keep you fully immersed. It's visually rich and thematically sharp—just top-tier across the board.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>) stands out in its own quiet, contemplative way. There are no flashy action scenes or overly dramatic animation, but its emotional storytelling, voice performances, and subtle direction carry a unique power. This week’s episode, centered around a subdued yet touching storyline, was simply masterful. Yuji Kameyama’s voice acting as Mosuke, along with Ai Kayano’s nuanced performance as OFuu, were absolute highlights. For me, it was hands down the best episode of the season so far—an example of what makes Japanese animation so beautiful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Close behind was <strong>Witch Watch</strong> (<em>Witch Watch</em>), which completely won me over with episode 2. The first episode was decent, but the second was explosively funny and sharp—just a blast to watch. Also holding strong is the <strong>Shoushimin Series</strong> (<em>Shoushimin Series</em>), which continues to impress with its flawless pacing and meticulous writing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other solid entries include the consistently refined <strong>The Apothecary Diaries</strong> (<em>Kusuriya no Hitorigoto</em>) and the stylishly restrained <strong>Generic Romance</strong> (<em>Kurun: Generic Romance</em>).
  </p>
  <p>
    On the flip side, some titles are already in critical condition. By episode two, <strong>Can a Boy-Girl Friendship Survive? </strong> (<em>Danjo no Yuujou wa Seiritsu suru? Iya, Shinai!!</em>), <strong>Summer Pockets</strong>, <strong>The SHiunji Family Children</strong> (<em>Shiunji-ke no Kodomotachi</em>), <strong>Lazarus</strong> (<em>Lazaro</em>), and <strong>Food For the Soul</strong> (<em>Hibi wa Sugiredo Meshi wa Umasi</em>) have all landed on the chopping block.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for <strong>Rock Is a Lady's Modesty</strong> (<em>Rock wa Shukujo no Tashinami deshite</em>), episodes 1 and 2 had some charm, but if it slips again next week, it’s likely getting the axe.
  </p>
  <p>
    Already dropped are <strong>Your Forma</strong>, <strong>Mono: Weekend Animation</strong> (<em>Mono</em>), and <strong>Food For the Soul</strong> (<em>Hibi wa Sugiredo Meshi wa Umasi</em>)—this last one is now officially removed from the rankings.

  <section class="overview-conclusion">
    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
    And there you have it—a broad but heartfelt summary of this week’s anime rankings.
  </p>
  <p>
    The season started with a total of 27 titles. Last week, 5 shows were removed from the pool, and this week, another 3 have dropped out. That brings us down to 22 active entries as of Week 2, with 19 remaining for Week 3.
  </p>
  <p>
    Things will likely continue to shift in the coming weeks. It’s still early in the season, and many shows are just getting into gear—anything can happen from here.
  </p>
  <p>
    But no matter how the rankings evolve, one thing is clear: there’s so much to look forward to. So let’s keep going, together, as we follow the twists and turns of the Spring 2025 anime season. See you next week!
