    <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
    <p>After being completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of shows during the prelim round and Week 1, things have finally started to settle down a bit as we head into Week 2 of the Summer 2025 season. It feels like we’re hitting the reset button here—time to catch our breath and really dig in.</p>

    <p>As always, this season is packed with buzzworthy titles, both brand-new and returning series. So then, how did things shake out in Week 2? Let’s take a look.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
  <p>As I mentioned back in the Prelim Week 1 overview, the Summer 2025 anime season started off a bit underwhelming. It felt like the initial momentum was lacking, and honestly, there was a sense of disappointment. So how did things go in Week 2?</p>

<p>Well, unfortunately, that feeling hasn’t quite gone away. As you can see from the rankings, only the #1 title earned 9 points, and even the #2 spot dropped to just 8. This is extremely low—easily one of the worst scoring weeks in the last five years.</p>

<p>That said, it’s not that every show was terrible. It’s just that few felt genuinely satisfying—like the kind where you watch an episode and think, “Yup, that was amazing, 9 points, easy.” That kind of punch just hasn’t been there yet, regardless of whether the title is new or a sequel.</p>

<p>Let’s start with <strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>), which holds the top spot for a second week in a row. It’s really doing well. While Ruri’s actions and comments in Episode 1 were a bit off-putting, Episode 2 showed the beginning of change. Her values seem to be shifting, and her growth is all the more striking because of how blunt and carefree she was at first, often speaking her mind without much thought for others. That childish honesty is exactly what makes her growth feel so meaningful. That contrast is what makes her shine. Her declaration at the end—“I will never sell this”—suddenly carried such a powerful meaning. It was a beautiful episode.</p>

<p>At #2 we have <strong>Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus</strong> (<em>Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai</em>). It was a solid entry this week. The heroine, Uzuki Hirokawa, was adorable and compelling, and her emotional journey—one of both inevitability and reluctance—was portrayed effectively. Her farewell from college, and from Azusagawa, carried a bittersweet tone. Everything was depicted with minimal waste and sharp precision, but perhaps because of that very tightness, it lacked a certain emotional reach. That’s why, for me, it didn’t quite earn a satisfying 9—so I gave it an 8.9. Still, I liked it a lot.</p>

<p>In 3rd place, we’ve got <strong>Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>). I personally love this show, but even taking a more neutral stance, I’d say it still has way more to give—or maybe it just hasn’t recaptured the beauty it had in the first season. This episode stood out for its emotional impact—the idea that when someone becomes a vampire, they lose all memories of their previous human self, including their most cherished feelings. It was bittersweet and well done. I hope the show ramps up from here.</p>

<p>At #4 we find <strong>See You Tomorrow at the Food Court</strong> (<em>Food Court de, Mata Ashita</em>). Honestly, I had no expectations for this. The setup—two high school girls talking at a mall food court—felt flat to me. But Harada’s writing truly shines here. The dialogue is sharp, the rhythm is snappy, and there’s a surprising amount of narrative cohesion. The gyaru character is especially fun—surprisingly grounded and kind. This duo is starting to grow on me, and I hope it gets even better.</p>

<p>In 5th place, we have <strong>Secrets of the Silent Witch</strong> (<em>Silent Witch: Chinmoku no Majo no Kakushigoto</em>). Personally, I’d say it’s one of the better ones this season—especially when compared to others. It suddenly turned into an instant detective story this week, which was unexpected but at least a bit enjoyable. The visuals are cute and clean, and the show’s doing a decent job overall. I’m usually not fond of shy or socially awkward protagonists, but this one is somehow, surprisingly, working—for now.</p>

<p>Now let’s shine a little spotlight on some shows outside the Top 5.</p>

<p><strong>Grand Blue Dreaming Season 2</strong> (<em>Grand Blue 2nd Season</em>) almost didn’t make it through Week 1. It was on the brink of being dropped. But then came the story with the little sister—an unexpectedly charming and heartfelt moment. Her awkward, a kind of tsundere way of showing affection was endearing, and while her brother is portrayed as a total goof, he still gets what his little sister is really thinking—just because he is her brother. If it hadn’t been for this episode, I definitely would’ve dropped it, but this one saved it.</p>

<p><strong>Solo Camping for Two</strong> (<em>Futari Solo Camp</em>) was also better than expected. The heroine who annoyed me in Episode 1 came back with a more grounded, thoughtful demeanor. I liked how she made a proper promise and request to the older guy. His refusal to pander to her was refreshing—seriously, it’s rare to see a male anime character who doesn’t bend over backward to impress a girl. If they can improve the animation (which was pretty rough), I’m actually hopeful.</p>

<p>And lastly, <strong>Turkey!</strong> (<em>Turkey!</em>)... ended up dead last, as expected. I’ll admit I still had a shred of hope after Episode 1, but watching a bowling ball roll perfectly straight down a dirt path in feudal Japan to take down a rogue samurai (or a hired blade)? I can’t. It was bad. But strangely, I get this feeling that the show might hit us with something unexpectedly moving later on. Maybe. It’s ridiculous, yes—but I’m probably going to keep watching.</p>

<p>
<h4> Titles Dropped This Week (with brief notes)</h3>
  <p>
  Unfortunately, four titles have been dropped from consideration this week:
  </p>
<ul class="dropped-comment-list">
  <li><strong>Watari-kun’s ****** Is About to Collapse</strong> — It had a baffling first episode. I hoped it would improve, and it actually did in the second—it was surprisingly decent. And the third? Honestly, "what the hell is this?"  At that point, I was done. I just don’t care anymore.</li>
  <li><strong>Bad Girl</strong> — It was just… bad. It felt impossible to sit through.</li>
  <li><strong>Fermat no Ryouri</strong> — It actually had some merits. It wasn’t just brainless nonsense—it had moments where the culinary focus was surprisingly well handled and even a bit passionate. That said, I still found myself feeling like this was a good point to step away. It’s not that it was terrible, but I realized I didn’t need to keep evaluating it. If I continue watching, it’ll be more for casual fun, not serious consideration.</li>
  <li><strong>Cultural Exchange With a Game Centre Girl</strong> — It has been on thin ice since Episode 1. Episode 2 sealed the deal—boring, poorly acted, bad storytelling, weak OP/ED… it had nothing redeeming. Easily the worst of the bunch.

    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>And that wraps up my quick overview of Week 2 of the Summer 2025 anime season. Overall, we’re still not seeing any major shake-ups across the board. Many of the most anticipated titles seem to still be finding their footing, and it feels like this season is testing our patience more than anything else.</p> <p>Where things will go from here is anyone’s guess. Will we see a dramatic turnaround? Will some dark horses emerge from the shadows? It’s hard not to be curious—and hopeful.</p> <p>If you’ve got thoughts, favorites, or anything that stood out to you this week, feel free to share them. I’d love to hear what resonated with you. Until then, see you next week!</p>
