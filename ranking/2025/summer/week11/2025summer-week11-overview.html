<section class="overview-intro"> <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3> <p>We’ve now reached <strong>Week 11</strong> of the Summer 2025 anime season.</p> <p>With most shows landing on Episodes 11 or 12—and within our ranking pool, no fewer than six titles wrapped up their runs this week. The rest are right in the thick of their climaxes, so things must be heating up finally (I wish…).</p> <p>So then—how did this week’s ranking turn out? Let’s dive in and take a look!</p> </section>

  <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
  <section>
    <h5><strong>**Notice**</strong></h5>
    <p>This week, <strong><em>Sword of the Demon Hunter</em></strong> didn’t air (pushed to next week), so the total number of active titles remains at <strong>17</strong>.</p>

    <p>As always, if you’d like more detailed (or occasionally half-baked) thoughts on the Top 5 and the three pickup titles, be sure to check out the <strong>Review</strong> buttons in the ranking table.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Once again, the lineup of top-ranked shows and highlighted picks turned out to be quite interesting. Personally, I find these end-of-season developments—not just in the rankings, but in the cour as a whole—really exciting. (Of course, there are exceptions that don’t exactly thrill me, but even those have their place.)<br>
    So, shall we jump right into No. 1? …Almost. A quick heads-up first.</p>

    <p>Like last week, this overview will be a bit more concise than usual, partly due to timing and partly because many shows are approaching their final episodes. Some of those endings will likely be discussed in the final season ranking instead. That said, the full reviews for each title—both EN and JP—are written up properly this week, so please check them out if you're curious. Thanks for your understanding!</p>
  </section>


    <h4 class="section-top5">Top 5 (Ranked Works)</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>
    <p><strong><big>1st – Dr. Stone: Science Future Part 2</big></strong> (<em>Dr.STONE SCIENCE FUTURE – Final Season, 2nd Cour</em>)</p>
    <p>See the review section for full thoughts. Below is just a brief impression.</p>

    <p>All the praise in the world goes to Suika. Watching this episode without tears? Impossible. What kept her going for seven long years was the memory of her friends—and more than that, the look in their eyes even after petrification, eyes that never lost their light. Senku’s final words of praise brought everything home, and yes, the tears too.</p>

    <p>Honestly, like Senku said, I’m just glad it was “only seven years.” If it had been decades, I don’t think I could’ve recovered.</p><br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong><big>2nd – April Showers Bring May Flowers</big></strong> (<em>Busu ni Hanataba wo.</em>)</p>
    <p>Full review is available as always—this is the short version.</p>

    <p>Gotanda really showed up this week—absolute respect. It’s the kind of moment that makes you think, “That’s the kind of guy I want to be.” And thanks to that, Uguisudani’s growth hit even harder. These two just keep getting better.</p>

    <p>Now Ueno has confessed, and with just one episode left, I can’t wait to see how it all ends.</p><br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong><big>3rd – Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus</big></strong> (<em>Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai</em>)</p>
    <p>As always, the full review is up—here’s a quick summary.</p>

    <p>After all this time, the Kirishima Touko subplot is finally going somewhere. Things are getting more interesting again. Honestly, the story doesn’t really work unless we reach this final stretch—it’s all about the payoff.</p>

    <p>Also, we didn’t get any Mai/Sakuta old-couple banter this week, which (personally) was kind of a relief.</p><br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong><big>4th – Me and the Alien MuMu</big></strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuMu</em>)</p>
    <p>See the review section for full impressions—here’s a quick one.</p>

    <p>The show has now reached its finale. But this week’s ranking isn’t just about the final episode—it’s recognition for two full cours of fun, well-paced storytelling that wrapped things up nicely. I really wish it could keep going. Hoping for a Season 2!</p>

    <p>Sakurako, Samezu, the ikemen—what happens to this triangle? I want to know!</p><br>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong><big>5th – Ruri Rocks</big></strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>)</p>
    <p>As with the others, check the review for full thoughts—this is just the short take.</p>

    <p>Another tightly written episode. What started as a simple interest in pretty stones has evolved—now it’s about how Ruri sees her future, shaped by everything she’s experienced along the way. The show keeps finding ways to deepen its core themes.</p>

    <p>Meeting Nagi, Imari, and Garasu—and what she’s learned from them—has helped Ruri move forward. That’s why she was able to hear the “voice of the Seiryuu Legend” and discover the cluster of sapphires at the end of this journey.</p><br>
  </li>
</ul>

<br>
      <p>That wraps up our quick takes on the Top 5. Now let’s move on to a few spotlight titles that didn’t make the ranking but still caught our attention—some for good reasons, others… not so much.</p>
<br>

<h4 class="three-picks">Spotlight</h4>
<p><strong>My Dress-Up Darling Season 2</strong> (<em>Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2</em>)</p>
<p>Once again, the production quality was top-notch—truly impressive. And while I didn’t dislike it (Asahi’s reactions were a highlight), I couldn’t help but feel like the final episode left things strangely unresolved, both in tone and structure. It made me wonder: what was this cour ultimately trying to say?</p>
<p><small>*See the full review in the ranking table. (Heads-up: it might lean a little negative.)</small></p>
<br>

<h4 class="three-picks">Editor’s Pick</h4>
<p><strong>The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity</strong> (<em>Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku</em>)</p>
<p>Watching this episode, I felt embarrassed for forgetting that our local Shichirigahama beach is actually a no-swimming zone. For a second, I found myself thinking, “Why aren’t they in swimsuits?” or “High schoolers not swimming in the summer? Come on!”</p>

<p>Despite some mixed feelings—nothing huge, just a lingering lack of clarity—the episode was overall strong and heartfelt, earning it a spot here. Looking ahead to the finale, I’m curious how it’ll wrap up. Among the CloverWorks trio this season, this one has definitely been my favorite.</p>
<p><small>*More thoughts in the review, if you’re curious.</small></p>
<br>

<h4 class="three-picks">Dookie</h4>
<p><strong>Rent-a-Girlfriend Season 4</strong> (<em>Kanojo, Okarishimasu 4th Season</em>)</p>

<p>An absolutely devastating finale—in all the worst ways. If you need a number to sum it up: this one scored a 3. That’s all you need to know. The only saving grace? Grandma and the parents. Otherwise, this was just a drawn-out “confession tease” mess. Still, you’ve got to give it credit for being spectacularly bad.</p>

<p><small>*See the review table for the full lament.</small></p>



<p>Those were this week’s three pickups outside the Top 5. A few shows ranked below honestly could have slipped into 5th place in a different week, so let’s run through the full list from 6th down to the bottom with some quick notes.</p><br>


<!-- Ranks 6 and Below -->
      <section>
  <h4>Ranks 6 and Below</h4>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li>6th: <strong>Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</strong> (<em>Dekin no Mogura</em>)</li>
    <li>7th: <strong>My Dress-Up Darling Season 2</strong> (<em>Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2</em>)</li>
    <li>8th: <strong>The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity</strong> (<em>Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku</em>)</li>

    <h4>Quick Comments (titles not covered in the Top 5 & 3 Pickups)</h4>
<p>Normally, this is where I’d give some super-quick impressions of the “one-step-away” titles—but as mentioned above, that section’s been cut this week due to circumstances.</p><br>

<!--
<p><strong>Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>) — The action scenes were solid, but the story beats didn’t land. Kou’s deduction skills felt way too overblown, and the sequence where he arrives at Anko’s place before Nazuna felt contrived. The whole vampire-transformation setup can’t really be that simple, can it? I’m being tough here, but only because I hold the series to a high standard.</p>

<p><strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuMu</em>) — As entertaining as always. Tenkuubashi’s trivia spiels hit the mark, and the gag about frequency ranges backfiring worked perfectly. The aftermath around the candy shop—suddenly more cats and more college girls—was a great comedic payoff.</p>

<p><strong>Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus</strong> (<em>Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai</em>) — Hard to stay invested this cour. The main couple and the side characters leave me cold. Futaba being so easily swayed was disappointing. Mai showing her star power worked to some extent, and the hot spring scene had a rare spark of charm, but really—three people going on that trip? Not buying it.</p>
<br>

<p>That about covers the “one-step-away” titles worth a quick mention. As for the rest… nothing to say this week.</p>

 <!-- Viewing Status -->
   <section>
  <h4>Viewing Status</h4>
  <p>
     This week’s <strong>active evaluation pool</strong><em>active entries</em> for the weekly ranking consists of <strong>18 titles</strong>.
    However, since <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>) did not air Episode 23 (postponed to next week), the number of <strong>actually ranked titles</strong> for this week stands at <strong>17</strong>.
  </p><br>

  <p>There were <strong>no new drops</strong> from the rankings this week.</p>
  <p>Likewise, <strong>no new titles</strong> were added.</p>

  <p>However, with <strong>six shows airing their final episodes</strong> this week, next week’s ranking will cover only <strong>12 titles</strong>.</p><br>
</section>


   <!-- Conclusion -->
  <section class="overview-conclusion">
  <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>That wraps up Week 11 of the Summer 2025 anime season.</p>

  <p>Hard to believe, but next week is already the <strong>final week</strong> of the <strong><em><u>Summer 2025 anime season</u></em></strong>—Week 12!</p>

  <p>So instead of our usual weekly ranking, we’ll be bringing you the <big><strong>Final Ranking for Summer 2025</strong></big>. It’ll also include a number of dropped titles that have continued airing and stayed on the watchlist, so expect a loaded lineup—likely over 30 titles. That said, depending on when some final episodes air, the update might be slightly delayed, so keep an eye on the main page for announcements.</p>

  <p>That’s it for this week’s summary, but I’ll be watching closely right to the end. Let’s savor the final stretch of Summer 2025 anime together!</p>

  <p>As always, if there’s a title you’re following—or an episode you thought was especially good—feel free to drop a comment!</p>

  <p>See you next week!</p>
