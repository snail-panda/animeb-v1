    <p>
      Week 7 marks the turn into the second half of the season. Usually, this is the stage where shows deepen their stories or even shift their direction completely. So, how did this season’s lineup hold up?

    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      The biggest standouts this week were <strong>"Ninja and Assassin: Living Together"</strong> and <strong>"Ordinary to Become 2"</strong>. Both episodes had exceptional writing, direction, and scene construction, with a subtlety and depth that reward repeat viewing. Especially <strong>"Ninja and Assassin"</strong> — every scene was calculated and beautifully executed, making it one of the season's best moments so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other series like <strong>"Apocalypse Hotel"</strong> and <strong>"The Apothecary Diaries: Season 2"</strong> continued to deliver solid quality. On the other hand, there were some titles showing signs of losing momentum, with big differences emerging between top-tier series and others.

  <section class="overview-conclusion">
    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Expectations keep rising for the shows that are hitting their stride mid-season. But at the same time, quite a few series seem to be stalling or struggling to maintain their pace. Hopefully, the coming weeks will bring more sharp, engaging developments that keep audiences hooked.
