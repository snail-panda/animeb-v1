    <p>
Spring 2025 anime has now entered <stron>Week 5</strong>—almost at the halfway mark.<br>
At this point, most of the shows have firmly established their characters and story settings, allowing them to finally showcase their true strengths.<br>
The excitement is definitely building, and it feels like each series is starting to hit its stride.
</p>

<p>
So then… what developments did we see this week?<br>
Let’s dive in and find out.
</p>

  <section class="overview-highlights">
    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
  <p>Once again, we were blessed with an incredible week of anime. Not only did we get some brilliant episodes, but the lineup itself was nothing short of phenomenal.</p>

<p><strong>#1 – <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>鬼人幻燈抄</em> / Kijin Gentoushou)</strong><br>
This episode was a true centerpiece—a showcase of everything this series does best. The story was incredible, yes, but more than that, it was the way it was told. Each scene was handled with care, built up piece by piece, and conveyed with such depth and intention. That slow, deliberate layering is what truly speaks to the viewer. It was delicate, heart-wrenching, yet also warm and tender in a way that grips you deeply. <em>This</em> is what it means to move someone's heart.<br>
We saw the continuation of the soba shop subplot, with the owner chef and the girl (likely his daughter) helping out, plus the appearance of the protagonist Jinya and another patron samurai Naotsugu tied to them. To even <em>begin</em> to talk about this arc properly, we’d need a full separate page dedicated to it. That’s how rich the story has become.<br>
Unfortunately, many people still haven’t seen this show—and that’s a real shame. I can’t stress this enough: it’s a masterpiece. Please, just give it a chance.<br>
And while I won’t spoil anything, I do want to highlight one line from the soba shop owner:<br>
<em>"A house doesn’t come first. People do. A house exists because people are there."</em><br>
It was beautiful—reminiscent, in a way, of that famous line from <em>Naruto Shippuden</em>’s Itachi: <em>“It’s not that people become acknowledged because they’re Hokage. It’s because they’re acknowledged that they become Hokage.”</em> Not the same, of course, but I had to mention it. Anyway—this was <strong>truly</strong> special. Please watch it.</p>

<p><strong>#2 – <strong>Apocalypse Hotel</strong> (<em>アポカリプスホテル</em> / Apocalypse Hotel)</strong><br>
After three weeks at #1, <em>Apocalypse Hotel</em> was finally dethroned—by <em>Kijin Gentoushou</em> no less. But let’s be real: many people probably still gave <em>Apocalypse Hotel</em> a perfect score this week too.<br>
The “Whiskey Episode” was legendary. If it weren’t for <em>Kijin</em>, this would have been my easy pick for #1.<br>
There was a beautiful line: <em>“Time isn’t something that diminishes. Sure, our lifespan gets shorter, but time itself grows and evolves with us.”</em><br>
Again, to fully capture the emotional weight of this episode, we’d need a whole separate review.<br>
The scene with the final guest—a woman who once stayed at the hotel with her partner, now visiting alone—was deeply moving. Her quiet words at the end: <em>“Maybe I’ll come back here again someday then,”</em> lingered long after the credits rolled. Just... perfection.</p>

<p><strong>#3 – <strong>A Ninja and an Assassin Under One Roof</strong> (<em>忍者と殺し屋のふたりぐらし</em> / Ninja to Koroshiya no Futarigurashi)</strong><br>
If not for the top two, this would’ve easily taken the crown.<br>
That said, I owe this one an apology: I first watched it while eating dinner with my phone in hand and gave it a lower score.<br>
But when I sat down and rewatched it on a bigger screen—fully focused—I realized just how incredible it truly was.<br>
Again, this deserves its own write-up, but I’ll just say this: Konoha’s evolving feelings toward Satoko—actually Roboko, were portrayed with such delicate precision that I was honestly at a loss for words.<br>
There was this quiet message too: <em>Even if someone else makes “better” miso soup, the one made by someone who genuinely cares about you tastes better.</em> That hit hard.</p>

<p><strong>#4 – <strong>Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary 2</strong> (<em>小市民シリーズ（第2期）</em> / Shoushimin Series 2nd Season)</strong><br>
Of course, my personal favorite—<em>Shoushimin</em>—was outstanding again.<br>
We’re now fully into the closing of the arson case, and the long-awaited confrontation between Osanai and Koba Jogorou finally happened.<br>
That scene where someone laughs maniacally while smashing a birdcage with a hammer? Wild. Utter chaos. But <em>this</em> is the heart of Shoushimin—two people who aren’t really “ordinary,” yet maybe are in their own way.<br>
Things are clearly escalating from here, and I can’t wait to see how it unfolds.</p>

<p><strong>#5 – <strong>The Apothecary Diaries 2nd Season</strong> (<em>薬屋のひとりごと 第2期（第2クール）</em> / Kusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season)</strong><br>
It’s hard to believe an episode this good ended up in 5th place, but that just goes to show how stacked this week was.<br>
Interestingly, Maomao barely appeared this time—this was Jinshi-sama’s episode.<br>
Now, full disclosure: I’ve never been a fan of Jinshi-sama. When he dominates an episode, I usually zone out.<br>
But this time? He was incredible.<br>
There was real depth here—his interactions, his relentless effort for Maomao’s sake—it all came together beautifully. A truly engaging episode.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Below the Top 5 – Spotlights & Drops</strong></p>

<p><strong>LAZARUS</strong> (<em>ラザロ</em> / LAZARUS)<br>
This started with promise, but the disappointment has been real. Not that the quality is low per se—it just lacks anything new. No excitement. No buildup of emotional investment in the characters.<br>
The action is so over-the-top that it backfires. Physically <em>too</em> capable. I found myself pulling away emotionally.</p>

<p><strong>Once Upon a Witch’s Death</strong> (<em>ある魔女が死ぬまで</em> / Aru Majo ga Shinu Made)<br>
Ranked #8 this week, but honestly? A missed opportunity.<br>
The core idea—Meg being recognized by the townsfolk and receiving a title as a full-fledged witch—was great. But the execution? Sloppy.<br>
Meg is portrayed as ditzy and careless for no real reason, and her character turnaround happens in a single episode. Suddenly, we’re told she’s been collecting 40 “tears of joy” off-screen over several months despite no buildup, and then poof—everyone loves her. Lazy writing, sadly. I <em>wanted</em> to give this episode a 9, but I just couldn’t.</p>

<p><strong>Summer Pockets</strong> (<em>サマーポケッツ</em> / Summer Pockets)<br>
I’ve got nothing good to say. If you haven’t played the original game, you’ll be completely lost. It’s incomprehensible and aimless.<br>
I’ve officially dropped it this week.<br>
Goodbye.</p>

<p>And actually, we’re also saying goodbye to three other titles this week:<br>
<strong>Witch Watch</strong> (<em>ウィッチウォッチ</em> / Witch Watch),<br>
<strong>Uma Musume: Cinderella Grey</strong> (<em>ウマ娘 シンデレラグレイ</em> / Uma Musume: Cinderella Gray), and<br>
<strong>Rock Is a Lady’s Modesty</strong> (<em>ロックは淑女の嗜みでして</em> / Rock wa Lady no tashinami Deshite).<br>
That means we’re dropping four shows in total.<br>
So while we had 18 titles in rotation this week, we’re down to 14 starting next week.<br>
Hopefully, we don’t shrink too much further—but it is what it is.</p>

  <section class="overview-conclusion">
    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
<p>That concludes the Week 5 edition of the Weekly Anime Rankings.</p>

<p>This week again, the Top 5—no, Top 6—were all so outstanding that any of them could have taken the #1 spot. This spring season is truly filled with masterpieces. Or rather, it’s not just that the shows are great—it’s that each of them delivers something genuinely amazing every single week. It’s getting to the point where I can’t wait for the next episode.<br>
At the same time, they’re all so incredible that each episode feels emotionally heavy, in a good way. It makes me want to take my time with each show rather than rush through a long list. I want to savor them, one by one.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the lineup, I hope to see a bit more effort. As mentioned earlier, we dropped four titles this week. In addition to those, both <strong>From Old Country Bumpkin to Master Swordsman</strong> (<em>片田舎のおっさん、剣聖になる</em> / Katainaka no Ossan, Kensei ni Naru) and <strong>Can a Boy-Girl Friendship Survive?</strong> (<em>男女の友情は成立する？（いや、しないっ!!）</em> / Danjo no Yuujou wa Seiritsu suru? (Iya, Shinai!!)) are starting to look pretty rough. I hope they can bounce back.</p>

<p>All in all, it was another absolutely fantastic week.<br>
Next week marks the halfway point—Week 6—and things are only going to heat up from here.<br>
I’ll see you all again next week!</p>
