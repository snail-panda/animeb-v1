It all made sense—and then I broke down. I couldn’t move or speak—just felt like I was hit by a surge of electricity and burst into tears without even knowing why. I don’t think I’m even fit to rate this—what I can do is simply be grateful for having witnessed it. Arigatou…",

They were just too deep into their ‘best friend sharing a dream’ mode to realize it. Nothing really moved forward—same old cycle of confusion and emotional knots. The sister who popped up at the end? Where was she until then? That whole flashback just made the MC's long hair version seem better. What was even the point of the school sales ban drama? Or the three-person sleepover? Are they training for some art boot camp now? Anyway, that sister was random as hell. None of it hit. Just… dull and painful.",
