    <p>
      As we officially enter the second half of the season, many series are gradually deepening their stories and shifting their direction toward the endgame. There’s a sense of steady transition this week — not quite a sudden explosive climax yet, but you can feel the pieces being set in motion for what’s to come. It’s still a calm before the storm, in the best way.

    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      This week, <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter<strong> <em>(Kijin Gentosho) </em>and <strong>The Apothecary Diaries 2nd Season </strong><em>(Kusuriya no Hitorigoto)</em> stood out overwhelmingly above the rest. In particular, <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> <em>(Kijin Gentosho)</em> delivered what might be one of the most powerful and emotionally devastating episodes I’ve seen in the past few years — so profound and heavy that it felt like chains piercing right through the heart. Maybe I’m being a little too sentimental, but I honestly couldn’t help scoring it near the very top of anything I’ve rated recently.
    </p>  
    <p>
    Meanwhile, <strong>The Apothecary Diaries 2nd Season</strong> <em>(Kusuriya no Hitorigoto)</em> was its usual masterpiece of tightly woven storytelling, the kind that under normal circumstances would absolutely deserve the #1 spot. But <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong>  <em>(Kijin Gentosho)</em> was simply too extraordinary this time, so it takes second place by the smallest of margins.
    </p>
    <p>
    Outside of those two, <strong>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</strong> continues to be in a category of its own. While other series are carefully building up their arcs for a strong finish, <strong>GQuuuuuuX</strong> is still out there doing wild, over-the-top spectacle week after week — and honestly, it’s a blast. Unapologetically bombastic and thoroughly entertaining, it refuses to settle down, and that’s part of its charm.

    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>As the season draws to a close, it’s time for the final episodes to leave a lasting mark. Some shows might still have that one last scene to surprise us, to etch themselves into memory—not with fireworks, but with a quiet, undeniable presence.</p>
