    <h3 class="section-title">Introduction</h3>
    <p> As the Spring 2025 season enters its decisive final stretch, many titles are now facing their ultimate test. Series that have carefully built up momentum through layered foreshadowing and solid storytelling are showing their strength, while others that have failed to impress so far might find it hard to recover. Week 10 often marks that final turning point—if you can’t make your move here, there may be no second chance.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
    The unstoppable force of <strong>SHOSHIMIN: How to Become Ordinary 2</strong> and <strong>The Apothecary Diaries</strong> continued to showcase masterful payoff of complex plotlines and carefully planted hints. In a completely different style, <strong>Catcher in the Ballpark</strong> delivered an impressive ensemble drama, weaving together the lives of players, staff, and fans into a compelling seasonal narrative. Meanwhile, <strong>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</strong> kept surprising the audience with its wild, unpredictable developments—good or bad, at least it never fails to entertain.

    <!--<p>
      In contrast, some once-promising series like <strong>Kowloon Generic Romance</strong> quietly fizzled out, unable to capitalize on their earlier potential.

    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
    Week 10 drew a sharp line between shows with lasting momentum and those running out of creative fuel. For many series, this is the final chance to launch their ultimate push before the big finale. The stakes couldn’t be higher from here on out.
