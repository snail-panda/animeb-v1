        "en": "Absolutely mind-blowing.<br>Every element — the buildup, the puzzle pieces, the interwoven past and present cases, the subtle psychological moves by Kobato and Osanai — it all locked together into a masterclass of mystery storytelling.<br>The way even a so-called \"ordinary\" character casually stumbles upon a deduction that took Kobato and Osanai immense reasoning to reach — chilling, ironically. And the smallest details — like a simple discharge date quietly triggering Kobato's terrifying brilliance — show just how unthinkably sharp these two are. This isn't just mystery. It's on a level that honestly feels beyond what you'd expect from anime. Celestial.<br><br>Full Review: What's truly chilling is how all of these seemingly strange extensions of ordinary life quietly carry unsettling inconsistencies that piece by piece converge into something far more ominous and deeply unnerving beneath the surface.<br>Kobato's seemingly and weirdly uneventful hospital days, with Osanai never managing to meet him directly despite frequently visiting, serve as a slow-burning stage where every minor interaction, observation, and omission adds weight to the intricate mystery.<br>As the story masterfully weaves together the past accident, the unresolved threads of Hisaka's involvement, and the present investigation, every element locks precisely into place. The way both timelines intersect — with Osanai's discreet actions and Kobato's terrifyingly sharp deductions — pushes the tension into unsettling territory long before any big revelation hits.<br>The contrast between Kobato and Osanai's near inhuman brilliance, and the ironically simple, almost comical perspectives of ordinary bystanders — like the convenience store girl casually stumbling into conclusions that took the protagonists' painstaking efforts — adds a brilliantly layered irony unique to the series.<br>The intricate interplay between those striving to remain \"ordinary\" and the truly ordinary is anything but binary or straightforward — often ironic, subtly unsettling, and layered with a peculiar brilliance unique to this story.<br>The dread doesn't slam all at once; instead, it seeps in gradually, tightening with each step until you realize you're watching a mystery that operates on a level far beyond what most weekly anime ever attempt. This isn't just great — it's ascending into a rare echelon few series ever reach.",

It’s not just about nostalgia or meta/parallel possibilities—it's more about how creativity and imagination blend seamlessly with entertainment. It’s not only for longtime Gundam fans, but also surprisingly engaging for those unfamiliar with the series. While it’s still not for everyone, it resonated with more viewers than I initially expected. It was simply a (inter)stellar episode.",
