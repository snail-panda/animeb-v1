It beautifully depicted the bitter defeat, while revealing even more clearly how deeply connected everyone in the ballpark has become — the players, the fans, the beer girls, the staff, the security, and everyone whose lives have somehow become connected through this place — Continue Watching

It's not just about the fighting scenes — now it has everything: a fine script, well-crafted structure, strong character development, and superb action sequences. And all that in a single episode? Seriously impressive. Wish it had happened earlier — it easily could've earned A tier or even higher — Continue Watching.",
