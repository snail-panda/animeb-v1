    <p><strong>Spring 2025 anime has now entered Week 3.</strong><br>
The initial chaos of the early season is beginning to settle down, and some shows are already reaching a natural turning point. So, what shifts did we see in this week’s ranking?</p>

<p>This week, a few unexpected titles may have made some very unexpected moves. Let’s take a closer look.</p>

  <section class="overview-highlights">
    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
  <p>This week was a whirlwind of surprises, shakeups, and comebacks—truly a week full of movement.<br>
First and foremost, <strong>Apocalypse Hotel</strong> <em>(Apocalypse Hotel)</em> once again stood out with overwhelming strength.</p>

<p>The episode started with a vibe like “Is this some alien Tanuki spoof?” but soon proved to be wildly hilarious from beginning to end. Ponko’s unexpected job-hunting finale was the cherry on top—there was just no better word than “brilliant.” I couldn’t stop laughing.</p>

<p>Of course, many viewers (myself included) may have found the wild, messy behavior of the Tanuki clan extremely frustrating. But the deeper you watch, the more you realize there’s something more—something bigger, richer, and more meaningful behind the chaos. It’s far from just a quirky comedy.</p>

<p>Also fascinating was the contrast with the aliens from a previous episode, highlighting a shift in how “non-human customers” are handled—both in terms of hospitality and eventual human blow-ups. The quiet reveal that 50 years had passed was oddly touching, and Ponko’s voice acting this week was truly outstanding. The episode was full of these small but deeply resonant moments. The whole thing even makes you wonder, “What the heck happened to humanity?” This show is now officially entering “this might be dangerous” territory—in the best way.</p>

    <p>And then, of course, that <strong>Me and the Alien MuuMuu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>) also aired—and it was absolutely fantastic! Absolutely packed! Jammed full of content—yet somehow every piece clicked perfectly. From start to finish, the composition, pacing, characters, and voice work were all flawlessly aligned. The timid, rural-background heroine type actually mattered here. Dryer repairs, automatic doors, hot guys and cool girls, cat fights, club activity mishaps, illegal dumping, electricity bills—everything was on point. I couldn’t stop grinning. This show? It’s dangerous. No exaggeration.</p>

<p>On par with that, at least for me, was <strong>A Ninja and an Assassin Under One Roof</strong> <em>(Ninja to Koroshiya no Futarigurashi)</em>. It was excellent. Though I must confess—I initially gave it a <mark>6</mark>. Why? Because I watched it while multitasking at 1.25x speed. A shameful and unforgivable act for any serious anime fan. I couldn’t even remember characters like Yoshida or her father. I also glossed over the most important scene—the emotional weight of the female ninja assassin’s disappearance after struggling to keep her job at a Starbucks-like café. And there was this subtle but brutal realization: even if someone suddenly disappears, life simply goes on—as if nothing ever happened. No one even notices. That’s how cold the world can be. It wasn’t said aloud, but you could feel it in the silence. The emotional weight was completely lost on me the first time.</p>

<p>I repented. I rewatched it twice. And with proper attention, I upgraded my score from the <mark>6s</mark> to a <mark>9.5</mark> (*basically a 10). It only proved what I’ve known deep down: no matter how great a show is, watching it “halfway” will always ruin your ability to evaluate it fairly. I was reminded, through experience, that <strong>“background viewing is forbidden”</strong>—an iron rule for any anime fan or reviewer.</p>

<p>This week also brought a surprise revival: <strong>Your Forma</strong> <em>(Your Forma)</em>. I had already dropped it last week, removing it from the rankings altogether. But on a whim, I watched the latest episode... and thought, “Wait, this isn’t bad at all.” And so, I brought it back.</p>

<p>That said, the show still has plenty of issues. It skips over the entire first volume of the source material, so viewers are left without the emotional context or character dynamics. The story structure feels off, and most of the animation is... pretty rough.</p>

<p>The most baffling part? The male AI assistant character is weirdly well-drawn—while the heroine looks lifeless and uninspired. Still, the content itself had some depth and potential. It felt like a waste to abandon it outright. So I’ve decided to stick around a little longer and see where it goes.</p>

<p>On the flip side, <strong>Rock Is a Lady's Modesty</strong> <em>(Rock wa Lady no tashinami Deshite)</em> was a disaster. Shallow, sloppy, and lazy. It felt like the writers just smashed together “rock” and “rich girl,” threw in some bad language and edgy poses, and called it a day. The story, background, and pacing lacked any substance. It was flat-out boring. Honestly, I should’ve dropped it this week… but I’ll give it one more shot. Just one.</p>

<p>Worse still was <strong>Witch Watch</strong> <em>(Witch Watch)</em>. Last week, it ranked high. This week? A train wreck of Jump parodies. <em>Hunter × Hunter</em> was referenced endlessly, along with others, but it was all parody with no heart. There was literally nothing else. Just gags. No real story. I actually wondered, “Is this even legal?” That’s how far it went. Last week I gave it a <mark>9.25</mark>. This week? <mark><strong>5.5</strong></mark>. Didn’t expect it to fall this hard. Brutal.</p>

<p>And so, this week turned out to be full of twists, comebacks, and major shifts—a week that kept moving from start to finish.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p><strong>To sum it up:</strong><br>
You could say this was the season’s first true shake-up of a week. We’ve got plenty of incredible shows, and many that I’m already looking forward to week after week, wondering where they’ll go from here.<br>
At the same time, we have titles slowly gaining traction… and others that already feel like they’re on borrowed time.<br>
That said, I didn’t drop a single show this week—so I’m curious to see what next week brings.<br>
Until then, see you in the next Weekly!</p>
