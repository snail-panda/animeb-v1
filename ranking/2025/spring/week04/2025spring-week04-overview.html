    <p>
      <strong>We’ve now entered Week 4 of the Spring 2025 anime season.</strong><br>
       Some shows are just heading into their middle arcs, while others are tying up the threads of their opening acts. Carrying over the momentum—and the shifting lineup of contenders—from the past two weeks, the rankings are once again on fire. So, how did things shake out? Let’s dive in and find out.

    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
<p>Let’s dive into the heart of this week’s review. The top two remained unchanged from last week:<br>
#1 <strong>Apocalypse Hotel</strong> and #2 <strong>Me and the Alien MuuMuu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>).<br>
These two just won’t slow down—unstoppable, hilarious, and incredibly well-crafted. Somebody stop them! Or rather, don’t, because they’re that good.</p>

<p><strong>Apocalypse Hotel</strong> delivered yet another phenomenal episode this week.<br>
Ponko-chan, the daughter of the newly introduced tanuki family, began working at the hotel last week, and this week we saw her grow—deeply and movingly.</p>

<p>The episode opens with a quiet, almost mundane moment: Ponko on the rooftop, feeding chickens. There are several of them—likely some for eggs, others raised for meat. Among them is a tiny chick, pecking feebly at its food. As Ponko scatters the feed, she says gently, “Grow big, grow big,” not with cruelty or cold calculation, but casually, as if that’s simply how life works.</p>

<p>Out on a food-gathering mission later in the episode, she faces brink of life and death, and through that ordeal, she gains a profound appreciation for life itself. The episode was filled with rich, layered storytelling.</p>

<p>In the final scene, as her family joyfully eats the meal she helped create from those ingredients, Ponko can’t stop the tears from pouring. Saying "itadakimasu" in that moment must’ve meant more to her than ever before.</p>

<p>And after the credits roll, we return to that rooftop. The same tiny chick is there, eating again. Ponko softly repeats the same words—“Grow big, grow big”—but her expression has changed. It’s not dramatic, not suddenly warm or teary. It’s subtle—but unmistakably more human, more mature. Those same words now carry deeper meaning: gratitude, reverence, and care for the life that sustains her.<br>
It’s never spelled out, never explained. But it’s felt. All through the quiet framing of her expression.</p>

<p>It made me reflect on the meaning behind those tears—and I’m just so grateful for a show that can tell such a beautiful, heartfelt story. Truly magnificent.</p>

<p>Then there’s <strong>Me and the Alien MuuMuu</strong>—still riding high in quality and chaos.<br>
That Miss Campus “Hohoemi Komachi” girl who debuted last week? She’s back, and the ridiculousness continues:<br>
Sky-high electricity bills, a food processor, and a wireless charging system—somehow all connected.<br>
The club president, who’s a bit of a socially awkward tech-nerd, goes completely off the rails this week.<br>
What’s he doing? Developing a long-distance wireless charging system that can beam energy from a building rooftop to Komachi’s phone—because she’s always saying her battery’s dying.<br>
He’s clearly in love, though that’s not explicitly stated at this point. And it’s possibly mutual.<br>
This whole setup was not only hilarious but strangely touching. The show continues to surprise.</p>

<p>And then, hot on their heels are two absolute giants in terms of quality:<br>
<strong>The Apothecary Diaries 2nd Season</strong> (<em>Kusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season</em>) and <strong>Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary</strong> (<em>Shoushimin Series 2nd Season</em>) Series.<br>
They came in at #3 and #4, but honestly? Either of them could’ve been #1. Both were flawless—tight, sharp, and overwhelming in the best way.</p>

<p>The Apothecary Diaries continues to build and deepen its narrative, layering plot and emotional weight with masterful care. Every frame has purpose, every beat lands.<br>
It was beyond impressive—simply in a class of its own.</p>

<p>Shoshimin Series, on the other hand, delivered a breathtaking episode filled with rich contrasts and striking relationships.<br>
The opening banter between Urino and Kooriya immediately set the tone. From there, interactions between Urino and the heroine Osanai, as well as Jougorou, Dojima (a true representative of the “ordinary”, at least to me), and Nakamaru, Jougorou’s girlfriend, all unfolded with brilliant contrast and chemistry (or non-chemistry at all).<br>
Every relationship felt precise, intentional, and reflective—woven together with care.<br>
It was a deeply thought-out and beautifully constructed episode, where every piece fit perfectly.</p>

<p>At #5, we had <strong>Kowloon Generic Romance</strong>.<br>
This one’s tough to explain. The way it plays with pacing and atmosphere is just bizarre—but weirdly captivating. The 23 minutes felt like five or even less.<br>
The story development is still slow and a little off-center, especially in how it reveals its mysteries. But for now, its rhythm and tone are working beautifully. It’s highly enjoyable, even if it's unconventional.</p>

<p>Now for <strong>Uma Musume: Cinderella Grey</strong>.<br>
This week’s episode was widely praised, probably earning perfect 10s across the board.<br>
And yet… for me, it didn’t even crack a 9.<br>
Yes, I cried. Yes, it was moving. But it felt like being handed something that was meant to move you—like it followed a familiar formula too neatly.<br>
The emotional beats were predictable, and the relationships—especially between the horse and the trainer—lacked the buildup to truly earn the payoff.<br>
So while I felt things, I also found myself asking: Why am I crying at something that doesn’t feel earned?<br>
At this rate, I’m not sure I’ll continue reviewing this show.</p>

<p>Then we come to <strong>Rock Is a Lady’s Modesty</strong>—and oh boy, it’s still rough.<br>
It feels like a relic from a forgotten era—those cringey 9PM dramas used to push rising idols, but worse.<br>
Overacted drama, sloppy storytelling, and barely-holding-together animation.<br>
Even the musical performance scenes looked strained.<br>
The explosive emotional scenes? Dialed up to absurdity.<br>
It made me wonder: Is nuance dead? Has care in storytelling become a relic?<br>
Maybe everyone's just watching with “silent thumbs” these days.</p>

<p>Next, we had <strong>Can a Boy-Girl Friendship Survive?</strong> (<em>Danjo no Yuujo wa Seiritsu Suru? (Iya Shinai!!)</em>)<br>
And guess what—it’s officially hit the 4-point zone. Congrats on that spectacular drop.<br>
By Episode 5, the show already feels out of ideas.<br>
The characters’ faces literally change from scene to scene. The accessory-making plotline is barely there.<br>
The protagonist’s “first love,” Enocchi, is nowhere to be seen.<br>
Even when the male lead ends up staying overnight at the heroine’s house (prime romcom setup), the show completely skips any tension. No dinner scenes, no awkward bedtime moments—just a hard cut to the next day.<br>
Romcoms these days seem to have no interest in romantic tension—even when the setup is perfect.<br>
I guess this is the peaceful era we live in.<br>
It’s so bad, it’s kind of fascinating. I might just keep watching out of morbid curiosity.</p>

<p>Finally, some housekeeping:<br>
I’ve officially dropped both <strong>The Shiunji Family Children</strong> (<em>ShunjiKe no Kodomotachi</em>) and <strong>Witch Watch</strong>.<br>
Witch Watch is still drowning in unfunny parodies of Weekly Shonen Jump tropes—completely unbearable.<br>
Shiunji was just... nothing. Not even worth talking about.</p>

<p>Also, without even realizing it, I had quietly dropped a few others:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Zatsu-Tabi: That’s Journey</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Mono: Weekend Animation</strong> (<em>Mono</em>)</li>
  <li><strong>Food for the Soul</strong> (<em>Hibi wa Sugiredo Meshi Umashi</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>They just faded away from the watchlist without fanfare.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>And that wraps up our Week 4 coverage.</p>

<p>Who—if anyone—can break the stronghold of our top two?  
<strong>Apocalypse Hotel</strong> has now held the #1 spot for three consecutive weeks. Absolutely unstoppable.  
And <strong>Me and the Alien MuuMuu</strong> continues to impress with sheer brilliance and absurd charm.</p>

<p>Still, we believe there are dark horses lurking in the shadows—titles that haven’t yet made their way into the rankings but may soon shake things up.  
Will any of them break through next week? Or will the reigning champions keep their grip on the top?</p>

<p>Either way, the season is still in its early stages, and there’s plenty to look forward to.</p>

<p>At present, we’re tracking 18 ranked titles. While I’m watching more series in total, only 18 are included in the official rankings.  
This week, <strong>Witch Watch</strong> has dropped from the list, so unless anything changes, we’ll be down to 17 entries next week.</p>

<p>Let’s keep enjoying this wild ride through the Spring 2025 anime season.  
See you next week!</p>
