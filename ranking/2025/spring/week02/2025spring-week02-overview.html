      2025 Spring The 2025 Spring Season has officially kicked off! Here’s the Top 5 Ranking from the very first week. Which title claimed the #1 spot? Check out how your favorite shows did!

    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
  <p>
    This first week’s ranking is based on the best episode out of episodes 1 and 2, since depending on the show, some started airing a week earlier than others. So for fairness, the better of the first two episodes was evaluated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Looking at the actual rankings, <strong>The Apothecary Diaries 2nd Season</strong> <em>(Kusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season)</em> was simply outstanding, showing a level so far beyond the competition that it almost felt unfair to compare. Its quality really highlighted the difference in class and set a high bar right from the start.
  </p>
  <p>
    Close on its heels was <strong>LAZARUS</strong>, whose first episode was practically flawless — the pacing, the unstoppable parkour-style action, and the worldbuilding were all impressive. It might feel a bit familiar in some ways, but its focus on pure spectacle while still delivering clever setups made for a thrilling experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Once Upon a Witch’s Death</strong> <em>(Aru Majo ga Shinu Made)</em> also stood out, even if it surely lacks solid developments and was a classic tearjerker that pulled no punches in trying to hit viewers right in the feelings with its second episode. Still, there was something almost refreshing about how directly it leaned into that.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary 2</strong> <em>(Shoushimin Series 2nd Season)</em> made a great impression too. After the end of its first season, where Kobato and Osanai went their separate ways, it was fascinating to see how they now live completely separate lives — even to the point they hardly cross into each other’s worlds — while a new arson case unfolds around them. The tension of wondering how, if ever, their stories might reconnect made the show all the more compelling.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Uma Musume: Cinderella Gray</strong> was rock-solid, as expected from Cygames Pictures, depicting Oguri Cap — one of the most famous and beloved racehorses in Japanese history, known even by people who aren’t horse racing fans. With that kind of legacy, it was bound to be good, and it absolutely delivered.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then there was <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> <em>(KIJIN GENTOUSHOU)</em>, from Yokohama Animation Lab, which usually suffers from a pretty poor reputation due to past production issues and inconsistent quality. I had basically no expectations at all, but thanks to the one-hour premiere, which had been delayed for almost a year, you could feel the staff’s passion and care in how they handled the story’s atmosphere. Even if the visuals weren’t the absolute best, it was a genuinely moving, carefully crafted episode — a wonderful surprise.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other highly rated titles included <strong>Kowloon Generic Romance</strong>, <strong>The Apocalypse Hotel</strong>, <strong>Witch Watch</strong>, <strong>A Ninja and an Assassin Under One Roof</strong> <em>(Ninja to Koroshiya no Futarigurashi)</em>, <strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> <em>(Uchuujin MuuMuu)</em>, <strong>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</strong> <em>(Kidou Senshi Gundam GQuuuuuuX)</em>, and <strong>Rock Is a Lady's Modesty</strong> <em>(Rock wa Lady no Tashinami Deshite)</em>, all scoring over 9 points up through the top 15 — a truly remarkable start to the season.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond that, there were several titles just shy of 9 points but still in the high 8s, like <strong>From Old Country Bumpkin to Master Swordsman: My Hotshot Disciples Are All Grown Up Now, and They Won’t Leave Me Alone</strong> <em>(Katainaka no Ossan, Kensei ni Naru)</em>, showing a lot of promise. Overall, there were many series to get excited about this week.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, there were also some disappointments right from episode 1, shows that made you worried about their future — for example, <strong>Zatsu Tabi: That’s Journey</strong> and <strong>Summer Pockets</strong>, which arrived on TV after a long-awaited theatrical release, both looked quite shaky.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Your Forma</strong> skipped over its entire first manga volume, leaving me with no idea what they were trying to do, and <strong>Anne Shirley</strong>, a truly beloved classic, had a new adaptation that left me completely speechless. The 1979 Takahata/Miyazaki version spent seven episodes carefully building up what this remake crammed into one. There was no chance to feel the characters’ motivations or relationships properly, and the sense of depth was completely lost. I doubt I’ll be able to keep watching. It’s a shame because the original is simply too good, making the new version feel painfully inadequate by comparison.
  </p>
  <p>
    In every sense, Week 1 was overflowing with things to think about — both positive and negative.

    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
    So there you have it — a rough but honest wrap-up of Week 1, covering first and second episodes depending on each show’s release schedule. Of course, there are many more titles I would have loved to highlight, since I’ve been watching well over 30, maybe even 40 shows this season so far. Some didn’t even get a rating yet. It really was a bit of a personal marathon, but a fun one!
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, the truth is we still don’t know how most of these series will turn out. Aside from a few exceptions, there really aren’t any guaranteed winners yet, and that uncertainty is part of what makes following anime so exciting. I’ll be keeping up with this season and cheering it on as it continues to unfold, hoping that Spring 2025 will become a truly great season for all anime fans.

    See you next time!
