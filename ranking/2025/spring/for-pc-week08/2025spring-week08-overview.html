    <p>
      As we officially enter the second half of the season, many series are gradually deepening their stories and shifting their direction toward the endgame. There’s a sense of steady transition this week — not quite a sudden explosive climax yet, but you can feel the pieces being set in motion for what’s to come. It’s still a calm before the storm, in the best way.

    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      This week, <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> <em>(Kijin Gentosho) </em>and <strong>The Apothecary Diaries 2nd Season </strong><em>(Kusuriya no Hitorigoto)</em> stood out overwhelmingly above the rest. In particular, <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> <em>(Kijin Gentosho)</em> delivered what might be one of the most powerful and emotionally devastating episodes I’ve seen in the past few years — so profound and heavy that it felt like chains piercing right through the heart. Maybe I’m being a little too sentimental, but I honestly couldn’t help scoring it near the very top of anything I’ve rated recently.

    Meanwhile, <strong>The Apothecary Diaries 2nd Season</strong> <em>(Kusuriya no Hitorigoto)</em> was its usual masterpiece of tightly woven storytelling, the kind that under normal circumstances would absolutely deserve the #1 spot. But <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong>  <em>(Kijin Gentosho)</em> was simply too extraordinary this time, so it takes second place by the smallest of margins.

    Outside of those two, <strong>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</strong> continues to be in a category of its own. While other series are carefully building up their arcs for a strong finish, <strong>GQuuuuuuX</strong> is still out there doing wild, over-the-top spectacle week after week — and honestly, it’s a blast. Unapologetically bombastic and thoroughly entertaining, it refuses to settle down, and that’s part of its charm.

    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Overall, I think most series will continue to steadily build momentum as we head into the final stretch. I really want to keep watching closely, hoping they’ll deliver solid climaxes without running out of steam. For those shows that have already been on an incredible streak of strong episodes, I’m confident they’ll maintain their level and finish with style.

I’ll be here to keep tracking them, and I’m genuinely looking forward to next week’s developments as well. If you have any thoughts, reactions, or favorites you want to share, please don’t hesitate to drop a comment.

See you next week!
