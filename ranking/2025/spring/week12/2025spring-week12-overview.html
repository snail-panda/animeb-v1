    <p>
      The Spring 2025 anime season has finally come to an end—and with that, it's time to take a step back and look at the journey we’ve been on these past few months.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be honest, I didn’t have particularly high expectations going in. Sure, there were some anticipated sequels and a few buzz-worthy titles floating around, but nothing that made me feel like, “Yes, this is the one.” It felt like a season that would be... fine. Just fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started out sampling about 50 titles. After narrowing things down, I kicked things off seriously with 27 shows. And from there, as the weeks went by, the list gradually shrank. In the end, I wrapped up the season with 12 shows—a pretty solid and manageable number.
    </p>
    <p>
      And let me say—what a ride it was. Despite the low expectations, this season turned out to be surprisingly entertaining. A lot of unexpected hits, emotional moments, and unpredictable turns kept me fully engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were shows that exceeded expectations, some that fell flat, and plenty that landed somewhere in between. But taken altogether, this season had something special. It wasn’t just about standout masterpieces—it was about the entire experience, ups and downs included.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may sound a little like a conclusion already, but truly, Spring 2025 gave us a season full of surprises—good, bad, and everything in between. It started off quietly, but ended with a lot of emotions packed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with that, let’s take a closer look at the results. What stood out? What stayed with us? Join me as we walk through this season’s highlights.
    </p>

  <section class="overview-highlights">
    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
    <p><strong>SHOSHIMIN: How to Become Ordinary 2</strong> and <strong>The Apocalypse Hotel</strong> dominated this week with bold storytelling and satisfying payoffs. While titles like <strong>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</strong> stirred mixed reactions, they nonetheless made a strong impact.</p>
    <p>In contrast, some once-promising series like <strong>Kowloon Generic Romance</strong> quietly fizzled out, unable to capitalize on their earlier potential.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="overview-conclusion">
    <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
    <p>As the season draws to a close, it’s time for the final episodes to leave a lasting mark. Some shows might still have that one last scene to surprise us, to etch themselves into memory—not with fireworks, but with a quiet, undeniable presence.</p>
