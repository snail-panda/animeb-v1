      As we move deeper into the final arc of the season, Week 9 showed how many series are steadily and carefully building toward their big conclusions. It felt like a week of progress and refinement, with some shows delivering powerful episodes that almost felt like a culmination of everything they’ve been working on. At the same time, a few series seemed to stall or lose a bit of their spark, while others still managed to surprise us with some bold swings. All in all, it was a week full of ups and downs on the road to the finale, so let’s take a quick look at how things are shaping up.

    <h3 class="section-title">Highlights and Thoughts</h3>
    <p>
      This week, <strong>The Apothecary Diaries 2nd Season</strong> <em>(Kusuriya no Hitorigoto)</em> once again proved why it stands at the very pinnacle of careful, layered storytelling. It delivered what might be considered the ultimate payoff for all the small details, side stories, and even the seemingly unrelated ghost tale episodes that had been woven in since the very beginning. Everything came together in a breathtaking way that felt like one of the purest forms of anime storytelling I’ve ever seen — simply phenomenal.

      Meanwhile, the sleeper hit <strong>The Catcher in the Ball Park</strong> <em>(Ballpark de Tsukamaete!)</em> also delivered a truly touching episode this week. All three parts were excellent, but the storyline around Kojiro and Tsubaki Sanshiro was especially moving — far beyond a simple tearjerker, it had a subtle power that could resonate with anyone, not just baseball fans. The specially composed ending theme and its animation for this episode were the perfect finishing touch, making it truly unforgettable.

      Finally, <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> <em>(Kijin Gentosho)</em> also deserves special mention this week. It beautifully showed the transition between the Edo and Heisei eras — subtle but deeply powerful, far beyond anything I could have imagined. The play staged at Jinya’s high school, based on a script written by Yotaka (the prostitute from the Edo arc), carried so much of the story’s core and its characters’ essence. Watching Jinia and his classmates view the play together, then laugh and talk afterward — especially poking fun at how unfairly uncool Jinya’s role was — made the whole thing feel both personal and timeless. It captured that bittersweet sense of nostalgia, of time flowing on yet connecting the past to the present, in such a moving way. On top of that, the pacing and structure borrowed from traditional Japanese theater were absolutely spot-on, adding an extra layer of beauty and authenticity. I never would have imagined they could bridge 170 years of history so seamlessly, and it left me completely in awe — nothing but praise for this episode.

      And of course, <strong>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</strong> went full throttle again, spotlighting Hermes as a transcendent symbol of cosmic encounters across dimensions — a kind of “Meguriai Sora” (encounter beyond dimensions) moment that felt perfectly on-brand for the series.

      On the flip side, some shows continued to lose a bit of steam, which stood out in contrast to all these highlights. Even <strong>Kowloon Generic Romance</strong> (which had been feeling rather uninspired for a while) managed to recover a bit of its old spark this week, with a kind of sweaty, summer-like rawness in its tone. And of course, its disastrous portrayal of <strong>Can a Boy-Girl Friendship Survive?</strong> continues to be hilariously terrible in the best (worst?) way.

      All in all, this was a week packed with surprises, powerful payoffs, and plenty of reasons to stay hooked for what’s next.

    <p>
      Overall, it was a week full of surprises and powerful payoffs, making it truly exciting and impossible to look away. As we head toward the final episodes, expectations are higher than ever, and I know I’m not alone in feeling that joyful kind of frustration of just not being able to wait for what comes next.
