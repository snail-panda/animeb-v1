While keeping its light-hearted charm, all three segments truly hit home. The Kojiro and Tsubaki story? Cheat-level excellence. (Tsubaki and Sanshiro, by the way, are classically linked names in Japanese pop culture—think Tsubaki Sanjuro.) Who could watch that arc without tearing up? And the ending? That special ED song and animation crafted specifically for this episode—too much. It paired so perfectly with everything we’d just seen. Sorry, I can’t even see the screen anymore...",

        "en": "I didn’t expect the transition from Edo to Heisei to hit this hard—it was subtle, but so cleverly done it caught me off guard. The play, written by Yotaka (yep, the prostitute from the Edo arc), nailed the essence of the story and its characters. And the fact that the Heisei students were watching it, commenting on it—cracking up over how uncool Jinya’s role was—just made it all land even harder. <br>There was this quiet sense of nostalgia layered under the humor, like you’re laughing but also feeling the weight of everything that’s been lost. And the way they used traditional theater pacing and structure? Absolutely nailed it. It was tight, emotional, and totally immersive. No question—solid 10",

The way the story reveals the uniform — through Kobato, Osanai, and the junior witness — is a quintessential portrayal of intricate storytelling—painstakingly detailed, quiet, yet viscerally powerful, and overwhelming awe..
