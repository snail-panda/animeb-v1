Ryou is immediately pitted against the wild lands he winds up in and the slew of deadly monsters that call the remote subcontinent home. You’d think he’d forget about taking it easy when he’s stuck fighting for his life, but lucky for Ryou, he’s naturally optimistic, clever, and blessed with the hidden “Eternal Youth” trait. Twenty years pass in the blink of an eye, and each encounter along the way pushes him one step closer to the pinnacle of human magic. Little does he realize that’s only the opening chapter of his tale. A fateful meeting soon thrusts Ryou to the forefront of history, forever changing the course of his life... Thus begins the adventures of the strongest water magician the world has ever seen—who also likes to do things at his own pace!",

This law permits and even encourages lewd sex acts everywhere on the island, and refusing to engage in “reproductive activities” is punished almost as severely as a crime.  Junnosuke, a proud virgin and staunch defender of virginity, questions the legitimacy of this law. Determined to protect both his and his beloved sister’s purity, he forms the anti-copulation front NLNS (No Love No Sex) and sets out to destroy the Perveted Law once and for all.  “I’ll… destroy the Perverted Law!”",
