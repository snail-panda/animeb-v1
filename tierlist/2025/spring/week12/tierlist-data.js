  intro: "The 2025 Spring anime season has officially come to its end, and with that, here‚Äôs the final Tier List ‚Äî covering not just the shows ranked during the season, but also every title fully watched all the way through. Some series shook things up in the latter half, while others coasted along ‚Äî so where did they all land in the end? Let‚Äôs dive in and find out!",
  content: "<p>The 2025 Spring anime season was clearly headlined by <strong>The Apothecary Diaries Second Season</strong> (<em>Kusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season</em>) and <strong>Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary 2</strong> (<em>Shoshimin Series 2nd Season</em>), which kept their top spots all the way through with no real stumbles‚Äînot even a tiny‚Äîat all. Following closely behind, <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (absolutely fantastic job!! Yokohama Animation Lab!!!) and <strong>Apocalypse Hotel</strong> stood out as powerful and incredible surprises that almost caught up to the SSS-tier legends at certain points ‚Äî major props there. In particular, <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> has another season ahead, and I‚Äôm excited to see how it continues ‚Äî hopefully without dropping tiers!</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>The Catcher in the Ballpark</strong> (<em>Ballpark de Tsukamaete!</em>) deserves a big shout-out. Even without a massive budget or a high-profile spot, it delivered steady, heartfelt quality across the entire cour. Consistency like that is no small feat. Hats off to them. Moving on to the mid-tier zone, <strong>A Ninja and an Assassin Under One Roof</strong> (<em>Ninja to Koroshiya no Futari Gurashi</em>) and <strong>Me and the Alien MUUMUU</strong> (<em>Uchujin Muumuu</em>) absolutely deserve a mention for delivering some truly standout 10/11-point episodes through the first half and into the early late-cour. Honestly, they were holding S-tier status for a while and even looked like they might push higher, before losing steam near the end.</p> <p><strong>Kowloon Generic Romance</strong>, on the other hand, opened with fantastic atmosphere and mystery but couldn‚Äôt stick the landing, mostly due to an overly cramped one-cour adaptation of an unfinished source. As for <strong>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</strong> (<em>Kidou Senshi Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em>), let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî it was best enjoyed by turning your brain off and just rolling with its ridiculous chaos, which made for plenty of heated debate online.</p><p> Down in the D-tier, we had the glorious trainwrecks: <strong>Once Upon a Witch's Death</strong> (<em>Aru Majo ga Made Shinu Made</em>), <strong>Summer Pockets</strong>, and <strong>Can a Boy-Girl Friendship Survive?</strong> (<em>Danjo no Yuujou wa Seiritsu Suru? Iya, Shinai!!</em>). These shows were complete structural disasters and absurd and ridiculous in every way, but honestly, they were so bad they circled back around to being entertaining in their own bizarre ways, yeah, it was fun if nothing else. To be honest, there were plenty of shows (like <strong>Mono</strong>, <strong>Zatsu Tabi: That's Journey</strong>, <strong>The Shiunji Family Children</strong> and so on) I ended up dropping without regret (simply because I couldn't stand), but hey, that‚Äôs part of the seasonal ride too. I can‚Äôt forget to mention <strong>Lazarus</strong>, either ‚Äî it delivered such a jaw-dropping first episode I gave it sky-high expectations, only for it to nosedive right after and end up dropped. That was a real heartbreak.</p><p> In the end, whether you stuck to the top-tier masterpieces or dipped your toes into the more questionable titles or trashy side of the catalog, I hope you found something that made you smile.</p>",
  conclusion: "And that wraps up our final tier list for the 2025 Spring anime season. Honestly, it felt like the weeks just flew by ‚Äî there were plenty of truly amazing shows, some surprises (in both ways), and a couple of (hopefully) ‚Äúwhat-was-that-even‚Äù moments along the way. Starting by checking close to 40 to 50 titles and ending up fully watching over 20 titles including unranked ones was no joke (yeah, it was a wild but memorable ride). Overall, I hope you enjoyed the season as much as I did.<br><br>Summer 2025 is already right around the corner, and I‚Äôm looking forward to catching up with you again for the first tier list of the Summer season and the weekly rankings. As always, feel free to let me know where your personal top and worst picks landed, or any other thoughts you have! See you next season!",

    <h4 class="criteria-title">Tier Guide</h4>
    <ul class="criteria-list">
	  <li><span class="sss">üü£ SSS ‚Äì TRANSCENDENT/GOD-like tier</span> This is the anime. Beyond one‚Äôs personal taste, how can one not watch this? I know some still don‚Äôt. But that would be an outrageous mistake. </li>
      <li><span class="ss">üî¥ SS ‚Äì CELESTIAL</span> Cr√®me de la cr√®me. Absolute must-watch. You'll be absolutelly grateful.</li>
      <li><span class="s">üü† S ‚Äì GREAT</span> Strong execution, great energy,and consistency last til the end. Even if it's not your cup of tea, you won't regret it. This is where recommendations really start.</li>
      <li><span class="a">üü° A ‚Äì GOOD</span> Solid work, consistently enjoyable and featuring some great episodes, though certain parts may not have matched the overall potential. Fluctuations in pacing or focus, and occasional unsatisfying developments, keep it from achieving the highest ranks. Still, a confidently good choice.</li>
      <li><span class="b">‚ö™ B ‚Äì DECENT</span> Not essential, but fully watchable. Perfectly fine for light watching. You won't miss much if you skip it.</li>
      <li><span class="c">üü¢ C ‚Äì NOT (REALLY) BAD / ABYSMAL</span> Mostly fine for killing time, with occasional enjoyable episodes or shining moments. You may not really regret watching it, but overall it‚Äôs not deeply satisfying, either. Better suited for those who know exactly what and why they are watching ‚Äî fans who fully accept niche or even absurd premises as part of their anime joy.</li>
      <li><span class="d">üîª D ‚Äì TRASH</span> Pure and barely watchable trash that has lost (almost) any sense of coherence, quality, or anything that matters to anime, but can still offer a bizarre kind of fun if you completely shut your brain off and let the nonsense wash over you. Perfect as a ridiculous nightcap when you‚Äôre too tired to care.
      <li><span class="dropped">üîµ DROPPED / PICKING BACK UP</span> These titles entered the ranking pool after at least one episode and sometimes lasted deep into the season ‚Äî but ultimately were dropped for reasons like unbearable quality, personal incompatibility, or simply no longer holding my interest. Although not fully excluded and always open to a second look (especially if later buzz suggests big improvements), most of these shows are unlikely to return. And if they do, they often risk getting dropped again after another quick check-in. That‚Äôs the nature of the ‚Äúdropped‚Äù zone ‚Äî ranging from instant quits to near-season finales, they just didn‚Äôt make the final cut.</li>
      <li><span class="na">‚ö´ N/A ‚Äì Disqualified</span> Judgement made. In the void.</li>
    </ul>

  disclaimer: `
  <div class="disclaimer-title">*Note on N/A Disqualified Tier:</div>
  Most titles in the N/A Disqualified tier were dropped or excluded from my watch pool after the first few episodes or even during it. Some didn‚Äôt last more than a few minutes, while others were ruled out at a glance‚Äîor not even. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre all ‚Äúabsolute trash.‚Äù Most just weren‚Äôt my cup of tea or didn‚Äôt suit the ranking format. Some shows‚Äîeven if good or fun in their own way‚Äîjust don‚Äôt fit the structure or vibe of my weekly list. That said, yeah, a few were truly dookie.`,
