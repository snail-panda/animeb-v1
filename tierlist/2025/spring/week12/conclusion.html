<p>And that wraps up our final tier list for the 2025 Spring anime season. Honestly, it felt like the weeks just flew by — there were plenty of truly amazing shows, some surprises (in both ways), and a couple of (hopefully) “what-was-that-even” moments along the way. Starting by checking close to 40 to 50 titles and ending up fully watching over 20 titles including unranked ones was no joke (yeah, it was a wild but memorable ride). Overall, I hope you enjoyed the season as much as I did.<br><br>Summer 2025 is already right around the corner, and I’m looking forward to catching up with you again for the first tier list of the Summer season and the weekly rankings. As always, feel free to let me know where your personal top and worst picks landed, or any other thoughts you have! See you next season!</p>
