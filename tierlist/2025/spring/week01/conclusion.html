<p>And that wraps up my rough overall summary of the Spring 2025 anime Tier List based on all the first episodes I watched.</p><p>To be honest, there were a few more shows I started—but some were so bad I had to drop them mid-episode, or even just a few seconds in. They didn't make it here, for obvious reasons.</p><p>If you're looking for a more detailed breakdown or wider thoughts on the season, feel free to check out the Week 1 Overview in the Weekly Ranking. You'll also find more individual impressions in the reviews section of that post.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, I'm already super excited to see how the Spring 2025 season unfolds from here. The plan is to do another tier list update around Week 6, at the halfway mark—so I'll see you again then!</p><p>And as always, feel free to drop your own thoughts or favorite titles in the comments. See you next time!</p>
