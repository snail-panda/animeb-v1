<p>Let's take a quick look at the Week 1 Tier List for Spring 2025. Honestly, this season is stacked with strong contenders. Interestingly, I didn't plan this at all, but the number of titles in each tier turned out to be pretty balanced. Each tier feels distinct, with its own flavor and character—and plenty of shows that truly represent what their tier stands for. It's a deep and entertaining pool in every sense.</p><p>Of course, anything A-tier and above is already worth watching. I'd say there are at least 12 or 13 shows this season that are clearly strong right out of the gate. There are quite a few in the B-tier as well—titles with potential, but still hard to read at this point. And then… yeah, there are a few that were clearly bad from the start. No surprises there.</p><p>As for the very top: <span class="anime-title">The Apothecary Diaries</span> <span class="jp-title">(Kusuriya no Hitorigoto)</span> and <span class="anime-title">Shoshimin</span> <span class="jp-title">(Shoushimin Series)</span> are my unshakable SS-tier locks. No need to explain why. In the S-tier, we've got <span class="anime-title">Sword of the Demon Hunter</span> <span class="jp-title">(Kijin Gentoushou)</span>—a really pleasant surprise, and honestly a joy to watch. Episode 1 gave me a real sense of conviction from Yokohama Animation Lab. And then there's <span class="anime-title">Apocalypse Hotel</span>, which came out swinging with insane quality, courtesy of Cygames. I'm seriously excited to see where it goes.</p><p><span class="anime-title">Lazaro</span> also deserves a mention. The animation, scale, and energy were overwhelming—but where it's headed is still unclear. Still, the promise is there. All in all, the top of the list is packed with impressive work. I'm already looking forward to every week.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum… yeah, <span class="anime-title">Anne Shirley</span> is a no-go for me. That thing was a disaster. It was way too rushed—honestly, borderline disrespectful in how much was cut. Sure, some newcomers might still find it touching, and it's not unwatchable. But if you imagine the same treatment being done to a work you love? Yeah. That's how I feel.</p><p>The stuff I dropped? You'll understand right away if you saw them. Just no saving them. As for disqualified or ineligible shows—they weren't necessarily awful, but they didn't feel like they belonged on this list in the first place. So yeah, those were easy cuts.</p><p>In short: there are tons of shows worth checking out this season, and I'm genuinely excited to see how things evolve. I plan to do another tier list around Week 6—right at the halfway point—so we'll see who rises, who falls, and who disappears entirely. Stay tuned!</p>
