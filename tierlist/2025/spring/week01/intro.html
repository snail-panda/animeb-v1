<p>The long-awaited <strong>Spring 2025 anime season</strong> has officially begun!</p> <p>This tier list covers <strong>all 46 shows</strong> I watched the first episodes of during Week 1. It’s based purely on <strong>first impressions</strong>—so I hope you’ll take it as a casual and instinctive snapshot of how I felt after each premiere.</p> <p>That said, I didn’t make these picks randomly. Each placement reflects something that resonated with me: shows I enjoyed watching, ones that sparked curiosity, gave me a sense of potential, or simply made me want to keep going and see how they’ll unfold.</p> <p>So with that in mind, here’s my <strong>Tier List for Week 1</strong>—hope you enjoy!</p>
