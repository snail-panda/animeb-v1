<p>Let’s dive into our <strong>2025 Summer Anime Season Premiere First Impression TierList</strong>—Episode 1 edition. While the label says “Episode 1,” some of the shows included here actually had two episodes out by the time of evaluation, so keep in mind that some first impressions are based on Episodes 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Now, first off—this season is massive. At the very beginning, I had over 100 titles on my radar—somewhere around 104–105. From there, I narrowed it down to around 60–70 that seemed worth checking out. In the end, I gave scores to 45 shows based on actual viewing and evaluation. These are the titles that make up this TierList.</p>

<p>The structure remains the same: tiers run from SS to D, followed by Dropped and Disqualified sections. Realistically, the SS to D range represents my serious evaluation tier—basically, the works I consider worth ranking. Since I try to keep this group under 30 titles for sanity’s sake, I had to make some hard cuts. Some shows didn’t click with me. Others just didn’t feel worth scoring. And yes, there are a few that simply weren’t good. But these are my choices—subjective, of course, but honest.</p>

<p><strong>Overall First Impression?</strong><br>Despite the massive quantity... things aren’t exactly promising.</p>

<p>Frankly, this summer season feels underwhelming so far. Coming off an extremely strong spring season, the bar was high—and this batch stumbled. The big names, the sequels, the new hype shows—none of them really wowed me in their premiere episodes. The visual quality standard across the board has definitely risen, that’s true—but in terms of depth, narrative density, or emotional impact, many titles felt flat, flimsy, or forgettable.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s talk highlights:</strong><br>No SS-tier shows this time. That’s rare. Not a single show felt like a true knockout from the get-go.</p>

<p>S-tier has just one entry: <strong>Takopi's Original Sin</strong> (<em>Takopii no Genzai</em>). It hit hard. It was impactful. But honestly, it left me confused about how to interpret it. It definitely intrigued me—but I couldn't yet decide how I felt about it. Hence, S-tier.</p>

<p>I also enjoyed <strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>). It had charm and shine. Was it flawless? No. The storytelling felt clunky and convenient at times, but it definitely sparked interest.</p>

<p><strong>Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</strong> was another title I found oddly compelling. It’s hard to explain—there’s just something about it. I didn’t vibe with this creator’s previous work, but this one feels more promising.</p>

<p><strong>Clevatess</strong> (<em>Clevatess: Majuu no Ou to Akago to Kabane no Yuusha</em>) made a strong first impression. Visually striking, impactful, and it gave the sense that there’s real strength beneath the surface. Hopefully it keeps that momentum going.</p>

<p><strong>And the rest?</strong><br>Most shows... just didn’t land. Not terrible, but not worth a spot on the board either.</p><p>For instance:</p>

<p><strong>Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>)—I adored the first season. It was one of my favorites when it aired. So naturally, I was thrilled to see Season 2 kick off this summer. That said, my expectations may have been a little too high. Episode 1 felt a bit off—like it lacked the spark and dreamy pull that made the first season special. There were glimpses of that magic, especially in the zoo scene near the end, but overall it left me feeling unsure. Still, the visuals are stunning, Creepy Nuts is back with perfect music, and I’m hopeful this season just needs a bit of time to find its rhythm.</p>

<p><strong>City The Animation</strong> is based on a manga by Keiichi Arawi, the same creator behind <strong>Nichijou</strong>, which I absolutely love. Naturally, I was hyped when I heard it was getting an anime adaptation—and by none other than Kyoto Animation. Visually, it’s breathtaking. Seriously, the animation is so polished it’s almost absurd—in the best way. But content-wise? It didn’t land for me. The humor felt off. I wanted to love it, but Episode 1 didn’t click. Still, it’s early days, and maybe it’ll settle into its groove—but so far, not quite the spiritual successor to <strong>Nichijou</strong> I was hoping for.</p>

<p><strong>The Summer Hikaru Died</strong> (<em>Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu</em>) was one of the season’s most talked-about premieres—visually stunning, no doubt—but I’ve personally hit my limit with occult/horror themes. It didn’t resonate.<br>That said, part of the disconnect wasn’t just the genre fatigue. I also struggled to connect with the core relationship between the two boys—Yoshiki and Hikaru. Their dynamic felt vague, emotionally distant, and hard to parse. There’s clearly something huge and supernatural going on, but it’s all presented so matter-of-factly that I wasn’t sure how I was supposed to feel. The atmosphere is thick, the mystery is real, but I couldn’t bring myself to care about either character.<br>Is this meant to be a deeply emotional story? A slow-burn horror? Something BL-adjacent? I honestly couldn’t tell. Everything felt emotionally muffled and thematically unclear. As of now, I just don’t feel compelled to keep watching.</p>

<p>Even comedy-romance stuff felt off. <strong>Grand Blue Dreaming Season 2</strong> (<em>Grand Blue 2nd Season</em>) came back after nearly eight years, and I was genuinely looking forward to it. Season 1 was completely unhinged—in the best way possible. It was wild, ridiculous, and hilarious, but somehow, it worked. That chaotic energy made it charming and addictive.<br>But this first episode of Season 2? Something just felt… off. The tone had shifted, the jokes didn’t land, and the animation seemed noticeably worse. It was still nonsense, sure—but not the kind that makes you laugh. It just felt empty, aimless, and awkward.<br>When a sequel returns after so many years, you'd expect the first episode to either reestablish its world or at least recapture the spirit of what made it popular. Instead, it dropped us into a bizarre scenario that failed to be funny, failed to be nostalgic, and failed to explain anything. I couldn't tell who this was supposed to appeal to—or what it was even trying to be.<br>It wasn’t just confusing—it was disappointing. And honestly, I couldn’t help but think: Was this really the same show I once loved?</p>

<p>In contrast, shows like <strong>Fermat no Ryouri</strong> and <strong>Turkey!</strong>, both of which got buzz for being over-the-top ridiculous, were honestly more fun to watch. Goofy, silly, but entertaining.</p>

<p>Also, as a big fan of Hanada Jukki’s writing, I was delighted by <strong>See You Tomorrow at the Food Court</strong> (<em>Food Court de, Mata Ashita</em>). It’s not your typical anime—it's more like a low-key sketch or sitcom, with two high school girls chatting in the same food court every episode. But the writing sparkles: unique, sharp, and unexpectedly funny.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br>This wasn’t a strong first week overall. But I’m not throwing in the towel. Some shows take time to warm up. I’m giving them a few more episodes to evolve. But on the flip side, if something’s clearly garbage? I’m dropping it fast.<br>And yes—let me say this: I still don’t trust CloverWorks. Let’s see if they can actually deliver a coherent story from start to finish this time. Episode 1 (or even 2) didn’t leave much impact, so I’m watching with caution.</p>

<p>That’s it for now. Let’s see how the rest of the season shapes up.</p>
