      <li><span class="ss">🔴 SS – CELESTIAL</span> Crème de la crème. Absolute must-watch.</li>
      <li><span class="s">🟠 S – GREAT</span> Strong execution and great energy, just shy of that tiny spark of god-tier brilliance. This is where recommendations really start.</li>
      <li><span class="a">🟡 A – GOOD</span> Solid work, still holding attention. Definitely enjoyable, but started wobbling, or vice versa.</li>
      <li><span class="b">⚪ B – DECENT</span> Not essential, but fully watchable. Perfectly fine for light watching. You won't miss much if you skip it.</li>
      <li><span class="c">🟢 C – BAD / ABYSMAL</span> As most things fail to click, but faint hope still lingers if a few pieces finally fall into place.</li>
      <li><span class="d">🔻 D – TRASH</span> Pure trash barely justifying watch time. But sometimes bad enough for fun, creating twisted flashes of charm. Falling apart — yet weirdly still a part of what makes the full anime season complete.</li>
      <li><span class="dropped">🔵 DROPPED / PICKING BACK UP</span> Dropped for now. Some might get another shot to win me back. We’ll see.</li>
      <li><span class="na">⚫ N/A – Disqualified</span> Judgement made. In the void.</li>

  disclaimer: `
  <div class="disclaimer-title">*Note on N/A Disqualified Tier:</div>
  Most titles in the N/A Disqualified tier were dropped or excluded from my watch pool after the first few episodes or even during it. Some didn’t last more than a few minutes, while others were ruled out at a glance—or not even. That doesn’t mean they’re all “absolute trash.” Most just weren’t my cup of tea or didn’t suit the ranking format. Some shows—even if good or fun in their own way—just don’t fit the structure or vibe of my weekly list. That said, yeah, a few were truly dookie.`,
