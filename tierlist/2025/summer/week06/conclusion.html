<p>That wraps up the mid-season tier list at the <strong>Episode 6</strong> mark for the Summer 2025 anime season.</p>

<p>As a new experiment, I included titles that were dropped from the Weekly Ranking but that I’m still watching. I’d love to hear what you think of this approach.</p>

<p>Back in the Episode 1 tier list, I said this cour was off to a slow start and that I was curious where we’d be by Episode 6. Whether it’s exactly what I hoped for or not, things have gotten genuinely interesting. The Weekly Rankings are showing plenty of movement, and the whole field is trending in a good way. That said, we’re not done yet—the rest of the season is wide open.</p>

<p>Normally, the next tier list would come after the finales—around <strong>Episodes 12–13</strong>—but depending on how things develop, we might check in again around <strong>Episode 9</strong>.</p>

<p>For more up-to-the-moment context and impressions, please also see the <strong>Week 6 Weekly Rankings</strong> page along with the <strong>Reviews</strong> and <strong>Overview</strong>.</p>

<p>As always, if you have recommendations, favorites, or thoughts, feel free to share them in the comments.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. Whether it’s Week 9 or Week 12, see you in the next tier list. Until next time!</p>
