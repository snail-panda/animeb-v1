  <h3 class="section-title">Tier List (Mid-Season — as of Episode 6)</h3>

  <p>Right now this tier list covers <strong>36 titles</strong> I’m still watching (excluding fully disqualified/dropped ones). If we include shows I sampled for a few episodes, I’ve seen at least <strong>41–42</strong> this cour—possibly up to ~45.</p>

  <!-- SS-TIER -->
  <h4 class="tier-heading tier-ss">SS-TIER</h4>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none; padding-left:0;">
    <li>
      <p><strong>Takopi’s Original Sin</strong> (<em>Takopii no Genzai</em>) — Already finished airing. For detailed thoughts, check the Week 6 Weekly Rankings (post-finale). In short: a genuinely outstanding work that I want as many people as possible to see.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>Kijin Gentoushou</em>) — I’ve loved this since season one; deeply heartfelt and moving. I’ve lost count of how many times it made me cry. Please watch it.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- S-TIER -->
  <h4  class="tier-heading tier-s">S-TIER</h4>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none; padding-left:0;">
    <li>
      <p><strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>) — From episode one it’s been carrying the cour with consistency and heart. A terrific show.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>See You Tomorrow at the Food Court</strong> (<em>Food Court de, Mata Ashita</em>) — Who expected it to rank this high? Script, structure, direction—plus the performances—are superb, and I’ve grown to love these two leads. The finale has aired, but honestly I’m too scared to say goodbye to hit play yet.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- A-TIER -->
  <h4  class="tier-heading tier-a">A-TIER</h4>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none; padding-left:0;">
    <li>
      <p><strong>My Dress-Up Darling Season 2</strong> (<em>Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2</em>) — Still feels like it has more in the tank; could be higher. It’s a bit slow, but getting there. I just hope CloverWorks doesn’t blunt its charm with over-melodramatic direction.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>) — Likewise: good now, but I expect (and want) it to reach higher.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>) — I believe it belongs higher at its best; hoping the back half taps into that potential.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</strong> (<em>Dekin no Mogura</em>) — Slow-burn that keeps creeping up on me; wouldn’t be surprised if it climbs. I personally quite enjoy watching it.</p> 
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Dr. Stone: Science Future Part 2</strong> — Rock-solid and fun; for now, this tier feels right.</p> 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- B-TIER -->
  <h4 class="tier-heading tier-b">B-TIER</h4>
  <p>In short: decent overall. Not “must-watch,” but often rewarding once you’re in.</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none; padding-left:0;">
    <li>
<p><strong>The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity</strong> (<em>Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku</em>) — I’d like to see more lift from stronger groundwork and development—not just overly emotional, dramatic scenes; still, it’s fine.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Rascal Does Not Dream of Santa Claus</strong> (<em>Seishun Buta Yarou wa Santa Claus no Yume wo Minai</em>) — Tight, minimal, very “CloverWorks” in how it shows only the essentials. This week’s episode worked for me; Akagi is absurdly cute. Hoping for a touch more oomph overall. No rush, no pressure, and I’ll probably like the payoff anyway.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>April Showers Bring May Flowers</strong> (<em>Busu ni Hanataba wo.</em>) — Low-key but enjoyable; I keep watching. A small inconsistency in the C-part lowered this week’s impression, but I’m still on board.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Hotel Inhumans</strong> (<em>Hotel Inhumans</em>) — Once dropped from the Weekly Ranking, now revived; entertaining and trending up.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Clevatess</strong> (<em>Clevatess: Majuu no Ou to Akago to Kabane no Yuusha</em>) — A stunning first couple of episodes, then some rough edges (grit/brutality sometimes overwhelms). Still promising; I’m hopeful.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Solo Camping for Two</strong> (<em>Futari Solo Camp</em>) — Early irritation is fading; it’s settling into a breezy, watchable groove.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Summer Pockets</strong> — I worried in cour 1, but cour 2 has picked up nicely. The interwoven threads are landing; also, Umi-chan is adorable.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Fermat no Ryouri</strong> (<em>Fermat no Ryouri</em>) — I had dropped it from the Weekly Ranking, yet it’s hot-blooded and fun—an easy, enjoyable watch.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Apocalypse Bringer Mynoghra: World Conquest Starts with the Civilization of Ruin</strong>  (<em>Isekai Mokushiroku Mynoghra: Hametsu no Bunmei de Hajimeru Sekai Seifuku</em>) — It's still a bit weak, but I’m personally rooting for this to keep building momentum.</p> 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- C-TIER -->
  <h4 class="tier-heading tier-c">C-TIER</h4>
  <p><p>Broadly: I can’t get into these—or no longer can. Some have likable bits for certain viewers, but my interest is extremely low.</p> 
  <ul style="list-style-type:none; padding-left:0;">
    <li>
      <p><strong>The Summer Hikaru Died</strong> (<em>Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu</em>) — For me, the groundwork isn’t there: it leans on raw mood and occult intrusions without giving me a reason to care who’s who and why.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Dan Da Dan Season 2</strong> (<em>Dan Da Dan 2nd Season</em>) — I loved S1, and the craft remains high, but the anything-goes energy plus forced “feels” isn’t landing for me right now.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Rent-a-Girlfriend Season 4</strong> (<em>Kanojo, Okarishimasu 4th Season</em>) — Honestly skirting D: repetitive loops, wild turns, “call Grandma” as a reset button. Why Mami is written this twisted is beyond me.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Welcome to the Outcast’s Restaurant!</strong> (<em>Tsuihou Shokudou e Youkoso!</em>) — Watching casually; Atelier-chan is cute. Seems like something bigger and deeper is coming, but I’m not sure it’s fair to expect that.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Private Tutor to the Duke’s Daughter</strong> (<em>Koujo Denka no Katei Kyoushi</em>) — Also casual viewing; the cuteness keeps me here, plain and simple.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Uglymug, Epicfighter</strong> (<em>Busamen Gachi Fighter</em>) — Better than feared; still just “okay.”</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- D-TIER -->
  <h4 class="tier-heading tier-d">D-TIER</h4>
  <p>Essentially the bottom tier for me. I struggle to find anything to hold onto here.</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none; padding-left:0;">
    <li>
      <p><strong>Secrets of the Silent Witch</strong> (<em>Silent Witch: Chinmoku no Majo no Kakushigoto</em>) — Ep1 had me hopeful, but it squandered an excellent OP/ED (Hitsujibungaku) with clumsy storytelling. If all you want is Monica’s anxious schtick plus sudden “overpowered mode,” fine—but to me, it’s sub-zero cold.</p> 
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Grand Blue Dreaming Season 2</strong> (<em>Grand Blue 2nd Season</em>) — Painful comedown from the glory of S1. With no attachment to the cast as written here, nothing lands.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Watari-kun’s ****** Is about to Collapse</strong> — Falls flat for me.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>The Water Magician</strong> (<em>Mizu Zokusei no Maho Tsukai</em>) — No real spark.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Nyaight of the Living Cat</strong> — Also a miss for me this cour.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>The Shy Hero and the Assassin Princesses</strong> (<em>Kizetsu Yuusha to Ansatsu Hime</em>) — Concept doesn’t pay off; just baffling.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>New Saga</strong> (<em>Tsuyokute New Saga</em>) — Drab, with no sense of effective structure or showmanship.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon Season 2</strong> (<em>Jidou Hanbaiki ni Umarekawatta Ore wa Meikyuu wo Samayou 2nd Season</em>) — The production and even the premise feel lost in a maze.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>I Was Reincarnated as the 7th Prince so I Can Take My Time Perfecting My Magical Ability Season 2</strong> (<em>Tensei shitara Dainana Ouji Datta node, Kimama ni Majutsu wo Kiwamemasu 2nd Season</em>) — I hear some rate it well. While it isn’t terrible if you look closely, it’s still not worth watching unless you’re a big fan of "Ore TUEEE" power-fantasy shows.</p>
 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Addenda -->
  <h5>Notes &amp; Misc.</h5>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none; padding-left:0;">
    <li>
      <p><strong>Ginga Tokkyuu Milky☆Subway</strong> — I’m watching and enjoying this (B-tier for me), even if I don’t rate it as highly as some. It gives me a strong old-school Gainax/Anno vibe in a good way. It’s missing from the grid simply because there was no key visual on hand.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Nukitashi the Animation</strong> — I’m watching, but it’s not working for me at all; if included, it would be D-tier.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
