<p>The 2025 Spring anime season was clearly headlined by <strong>The Apothecary Diaries Second Season</strong> (<em>Kusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season</em>) and <strong>Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary 2</strong> (<em>Shoshimin Series 2nd Season</em>), which kept their top spots all the way through with no real stumbles—not even a tiny—at all. Following closely behind, <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (absolutely fantastic job!! Yokohama Animation Lab!!!) and <strong>Apocalypse Hotel</strong> stood out as powerful and incredible surprises that almost caught up to the SSS-tier legends at certain points — major props there. In particular, <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> has another season ahead, and I’m excited to see how it continues — hopefully without dropping tiers!</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>The Catcher in the Ballpark</strong> (<em>Ballpark de Tsukamaete!</em>) deserves a big shout-out. Even without a massive budget or a high-profile spot, it delivered steady, heartfelt quality across the entire cour. Consistency like that is no small feat. Hats off to them. Moving on to the mid-tier zone, <strong>A Ninja and an Assassin Under One Roof</strong> (<em>Ninja to Koroshiya no Futari Gurashi</em>) and <strong>Me and the Alien MUUMUU</strong> (<em>Uchujin Muumuu</em>) absolutely deserve a mention for delivering some truly standout 10/11-point episodes through the first half and into the early late-cour. Honestly, they were holding S-tier status for a while and even looked like they might push higher, before losing steam near the end.</p> <p><strong>Kowloon Generic Romance</strong>, on the other hand, opened with fantastic atmosphere and mystery but couldn’t stick the landing, mostly due to an overly cramped one-cour adaptation of an unfinished source. As for <strong>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</strong> (<em>Kidou Senshi Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em>), let’s be real — it was best enjoyed by turning your brain off and just rolling with its ridiculous chaos, which made for plenty of heated debate online.</p><p> Down in the D-tier, we had the glorious trainwrecks: <strong>Once Upon a Witch's Death</strong> (<em>Aru Majo ga Made Shinu Made</em>), <strong>Summer Pockets</strong>, and <strong>Can a Boy-Girl Friendship Survive?</strong> (<em>Danjo no Yuujou wa Seiritsu Suru? Iya, Shinai!!</em>). These shows were complete structural disasters and absurd and ridiculous in every way, but honestly, they were so bad they circled back around to being entertaining in their own bizarre ways, yeah, it was fun if nothing else. To be honest, there were plenty of shows (like <strong>Mono</strong>, <strong>Zatsu Tabi: That's Journey</strong>, <strong>The Shiunji Family Children</strong> and so on) I ended up dropping without regret (simply because I couldn't stand), but hey, that’s part of the seasonal ride too. I can’t forget to mention <strong>Lazarus</strong>, either — it delivered such a jaw-dropping first episode I gave it sky-high expectations, only for it to nosedive right after and end up dropped. That was a real heartbreak.</p><p> In the end, whether you stuck to the top-tier masterpieces or dipped your toes into the more questionable titles or trashy side of the catalog, I hope you found something that made you smile.</p>
