          We’re already halfway through the season! Here’s my updated tier list after Episode 8.
          Some shows continue to shine, others fell off, and a few... I had to drop.

<div class="tier-criteria">
  <h4 class="criteria-title">Tier Guide</h4>
  <ul class="criteria-list">
    <li><span class="ss">🔴 SS – CELESTIAL</span> Crème de la crème. Total must-watch.</li>
    <li><span class="s">🟠 S – GREAT</span> Strong execution and great energy, just shy of a tiny bit of top-tier brilliance.
</li>
    <li><span class="a">🟡 A – GOOD</span> Still holding attention, but started wobbling, or vice versa.</li>
    <li><span class="b">⚪ B – MID</span> Nothing special so far, but not painful either.
</li>
    <li><span class="c">🟢 C – BAD / ABYSMAL</span> Dropped in quality —or never really worked in the first place.
</li>
    <li><span class="d">🔻 D – TRASH</span> Barely justifies watch time.</li>
    <li><span class="dropped">🔵 DROPPED / PICKING BACK UP</span> Dropped for now.  Some might get another shot to win me back. We’ll see.
</li>
    <li><span class="na">⚫ N/A – Disqualified</span> Judgement made. In the void.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="disclaimer">
    <strong>*Note on N/A Disqualified Tier:</strong><br>
    Most titles in the N/A Disqualified tier were dropped or excluded from my watch pool after the first few episodes or even during it. Some didn’t last more than a few minutes, while others were ruled out at a glance—or not even. That doesn’t mean they’re all “absolute trash.” Most just weren’t my cup of tea or didn’t suit the ranking format. Some shows—even if good or fun in their own way—just don’t fit the structure or vibe of my weekly list. That said, yeah, a few were truly dookie.
