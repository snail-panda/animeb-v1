  seasonDate: "July 03, 2025",
  intro: "We’re already halfway through the season! Here’s my updated tier list after Episode 8. Some shows continue to shine, others fell off, and a few... I had to drop.",
  content: "The mid-season tier highlight definitely revolves around the sub-top tiers like A, B, and C.<br>While SS, S, and D are pretty much locked in — with  <span class=\"anime-title\">The Apothecary Diaries Second Season</span>,  <span class=\"anime-title\">Sword of the Demon Hunter</span>, and  <span class=\"anime-title\">Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary 2</span> absolutely dominating the top, and certain bottom-tier shows still proudly claiming their D-tier status —the real action lies in the middle.<br>Mid-tier titles such as  <span class=\"anime-title\">Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</span>,  <span class=\"anime-title\">Kowloon Generic Romance</span>, and  <span class=\"anime-title\">From the Old Country Bumpkin to Master Swordsman... </span>are still holding some potential to rise — though honestly, they're quite wobbly. From my personal view, Gundam and From the Old... have finally started showing some of their own charm, though not fully baked yet. And the thing is — back in Episode 1, these were among the shows I was really excited about.<br>I hope the next few episodes will give them the push they need to live up to that early promise.",
  conclusion: "That wraps up my Ep. 7–8 impressions. Thanks for reading! I'll see you again for the 2025 Spring Final Tier List.  (And hey—don't forget to let me know where your favorites landed!)",

    <ul class="criteria-list">
	  <li><span class="sss">🟣 SSS – TRANSCENDENT/GOD-like tier</span> This is the anime. Beyond one’s personal taste, how can one not watch this? I know some still don’t. But that would be an outrageous mistake. </li>
      <li><span class="ss">🔴 SS – CELESTIAL</span> Crème de la crème. Absolute must-watch. You'll be absolutelly grateful.</li>
      <li><span class="s">🟠 S – GREAT</span> Strong execution, great energy,and consistency last til the end. Even if it's not your cup of tea, you won't regret it. This is where recommendations really start.</li>
      <li><span class="a">🟡 A – GOOD</span> Solid work, consistently enjoyable and featuring some great episodes, though certain parts may not have matched the overall potential. Fluctuations in pacing or focus, and occasional unsatisfying developments, keep it from achieving the highest ranks. Still, a confidently good choice.</li>
      <li><span class="b">⚪ B – DECENT</span> Not essential, but fully watchable. Perfectly fine for light watching. You won't miss much if you skip it.</li>
      <li><span class="c">🟢 C – NOT (REALLY) BAD / ABYSMAL</span> Mostly fine for killing time, with occasional enjoyable episodes or shining moments. You may not really regret watching it, but overall it’s not deeply satisfying, either. Better suited for those who know exactly what and why they are watching — fans who fully accept niche or even absurd premises as part of their anime joy.</li>
      <li><span class="d">🔻 D – TRASH</span> Pure and barely watchable trash that has lost (almost) any sense of coherence, quality, or anything that matters to anime, but can still offer a bizarre kind of fun if you completely shut your brain off and let the nonsense wash over you. Perfect as a ridiculous nightcap when you’re too tired to care.
      <li><span class="na">⚫ N/A – Disqualified</span> Judgement made. In the void.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="disclaimer-title">*Note on N/A Disqualified Tier:</div>
  Most titles in the N/A Disqualified tier were dropped or excluded from my watch pool after the first few episodes or even during it. Some didn’t last more than a few minutes, while others were ruled out at a glance—or not even. That doesn’t mean they’re all “absolute trash.” Most just weren’t my cup of tea or didn’t suit the ranking format. Some shows—even if good or fun in their own way—just don’t fit the structure or vibe of my weekly list. That said, yeah, a few were truly dookie.`,
