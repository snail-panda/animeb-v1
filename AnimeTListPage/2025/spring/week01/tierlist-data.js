  seasonTitle: "2025 Spring Anime Season Premiere / First Impression Tier List – Episode 1",
  seasonDate: "April 14, 2025",
  intro: "<p>The long-awaited <strong>Spring 2025 anime season</strong> has officially begun!</p> <p>This tier list covers <strong>all 46 shows</strong> I watched the first episodes of during Week 1. It’s based purely on <strong>first impressions</strong>—so I hope you’ll take it as a casual and instinctive snapshot of how I felt after each premiere.</p> <p>That said, I didn’t make these picks randomly. Each placement reflects something that resonated with me: shows I enjoyed watching, ones that sparked curiosity, gave me a sense of potential, or simply made me want to keep going and see how they’ll unfold.</p> <p>So with that in mind, here’s my <strong>Tier List for Week 1</strong>—hope you enjoy!</p>",
  content: "<p>Let's take a quick look at the Week 1 Tier List for Spring 2025. Honestly, this season is stacked with strong contenders. Interestingly, I didn't plan this at all, but the number of titles in each tier turned out to be pretty balanced. Each tier feels distinct, with its own flavor and character—and plenty of shows that truly represent what their tier stands for. It's a deep and entertaining pool in every sense.</p><p>Of course, anything A-tier and above is already worth watching. I'd say there are at least 12 or 13 shows this season that are clearly strong right out of the gate. There are quite a few in the B-tier as well—titles with potential, but still hard to read at this point. And then… yeah, there are a few that were clearly bad from the start. No surprises there.</p><p>As for the very top: <span class=\"anime-title\">The Apothecary Diaries</span> <span class=\"jp-title\">(Kusuriya no Hitorigoto)</span> and <span class=\"anime-title\">Shoshimin</span> <span class=\"jp-title\">(Shoushimin Series)</span> are my unshakable SS-tier locks. No need to explain why. In the S-tier, we've got <span class=\"anime-title\">Sword of the Demon Hunter</span> <span class=\"jp-title\">(Kijin Gentoushou)</span>—a really pleasant surprise, and honestly a joy to watch. Episode 1 gave me a real sense of conviction from Yokohama Animation Lab. And then there's <span class=\"anime-title\">Apocalypse Hotel</span>, which came out swinging with insane quality, courtesy of Cygames. I'm seriously excited to see where it goes.</p><p><span class=\"anime-title\">Lazaro</span> also deserves a mention. The animation, scale, and energy were overwhelming—but where it's headed is still unclear. Still, the promise is there. All in all, the top of the list is packed with impressive work. I'm already looking forward to every week.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum… yeah, <span class=\"anime-title\">Anne Shirley</span> is a no-go for me. That thing was a disaster. It was way too rushed—honestly, borderline disrespectful in how much was cut. Sure, some newcomers might still find it touching, and it's not unwatchable. But if you imagine the same treatment being done to a work you love? Yeah. That's how I feel.</p><p>The stuff I dropped? You'll understand right away if you saw them. Just no saving them. As for disqualified or ineligible shows—they weren't necessarily awful, but they didn't feel like they belonged on this list in the first place. So yeah, those were easy cuts.</p><p>In short: there are tons of shows worth checking out this season, and I'm genuinely excited to see how things evolve. I plan to do another tier list around Week 6—right at the halfway point—so we'll see who rises, who falls, and who disappears entirely. Stay tuned!</p>",
  conclusion: "<p>And that wraps up my rough overall summary of the Spring 2025 anime Tier List based on all the first episodes I watched.</p><p>To be honest, there were a few more shows I started—but some were so bad I had to drop them mid-episode, or even just a few seconds in. They didn't make it here, for obvious reasons.</p><p>If you're looking for a more detailed breakdown or wider thoughts on the season, feel free to check out the Week 1 Overview in the Weekly Ranking. You'll also find more individual impressions in the reviews section of that post.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, I'm already super excited to see how the Spring 2025 season unfolds from here. The plan is to do another tier list update around Week 6, at the halfway mark—so I'll see you again then!</p><p>And as always, feel free to drop your own thoughts or favorite titles in the comments. See you next time!</p>",

    <h4 class="criteria-title">Tier Guide</h4>
    <ul class="criteria-list">
      <li><span class="ss">🔴 SS – CELESTIAL Lucky you found a treasure!</span> Overwhelmingly captivating in one or more areas—be it narrative brilliance, emotional depth, character impact, sheer originality, or inspired world-building. Encountering this show sparks joy and excitement. Completion is practically guaranteed—you're certain to see it through to the end. It already feels destined for a top-tier finish. In other words, absolute must-watch. </li>
      <li><span class="s">🟠 S – GREAT Highly possible you'll happily complete it.</span> Strongly engaging and rewarding—there's already enough substance or quality in this episode to make continuing feel like a given. You're quite likely to stick with it through the middle or even the final stretch, barring any major drop-off. A high-quality first episode or a clear sense of accomplishment and enjoyment justifies a strong early score. No clear negative signals to stop watching yet. You don't have other options—you should definitely not miss any titles from this tier. </li>
      <li><span class="a">🟡 A – GOOD Gladly going half way through at least.</span> There’s something clearly good here. While it might not hit with overwhelming impact, it definitely left a strong impression—whether in tone, worldbuilding, characters, or potential. You can sense that it *clicked* on some level and sparked curiosity. There’s enough resonance to say, “This could turn into something great,” and you’re motivated to keep watching—maybe 3 or 4 more episodes—to see how it unfolds. It's not quite a sure bet yet, but it's absolutely worth the time.</li>
      <li><span class="b">⚪ B – DECENT Not essential, it's your call. 3, 4 ep?</span> Perfectly fine for a light watch. The episode wasn’t bad at all—it had its moments—You might even find a few things you liked, but it didn’t really grab you either. It’s the kind of show where you think, “I could keep watching a couple more episodes,” but you’re not exactly excited. There might be potential, or maybe just enough intrigue to continue. At the same time, it wouldn't be a loss if you skipped it—there’s no strong hook, just a decent start.</li>
      <li><span class="c">🟢 C – BAD / ABYSMAL Should drop but may give 1, 2 more ep.</span> These shows tend to have one or more clearly disappointing aspects—whether it’s the visuals, the script, or the overall execution. That doesn’t mean they’re outright terrible; in fact, there’s often some appeal in the concept, setup, or worldbuilding. But something feels noticeably off. Maybe the art quality isn’t *terrible*, but it’s inconsistent or bland. Maybe the characters are somewhat appealing, but their actions or dialogue feel awkward or unconvincing. Maybe the story has potential, but key moments are glossed over or poorly delivered. It’s the kind of show that gives off the sense of being underbaked—like it’s missing a layer of polish or care. Still, there’s often a flicker of potential that makes you say, “Maybe I’ll give it one more episode,” even if you’re already thinking of cutting it soon. And of course, if you're not a hard core anime nerd, don't think, just drop it. </li>
      <li><span class="d">🔻 D – TRASH Don't unless you like trash.</span> These are shows that are fundamentally flawed—whether due to an uninspired story, recycled character archetypes, or laughably predictable developments. You’ve seen it all before: the overpowered, oblivious protagonist, the world running on convenient coincidences, the same character dynamics used for the hundredth time. Most of these titles feel like they were made to fill a slot rather than tell a story. That said, there’s still a certain beauty in failure—a kind of unintentional comedy or genre self-parody that can make them oddly watchable. In most cases, you’ll drop them after one episode. But sometimes, out of sheer curiosity or pity, you might give them a second look. If you understand what trash is—and you still choose to watch—it’s your journey to take. There’s an elegance to garbage, after all. And if you’re the kind of viewer who dares to sift through the muck in search of hidden sparkle, then who’s to say what value you might find?</li>
      <li><span class="dropped">🔵 DROPPED / PICKING BACK UP Some may watch it but not you.</span> These are shows that not only fail to present any reason to keep watching, but go as far as to trigger anger, disgust, or utter disbelief. They often include elements that feel unforgivable or outright infuriating. Despite our usual effort to be generous with first impressions, any show that manages to score in the 4s (or below 5) right from episode 1 has, by definition, failed beyond saving. There’s no second-guessing—these shows are dropped instantly. They’re not worth your time, attention, or even a hate-watch.  Occasionally, in rare cases—like when the show is an exceptionally hot topic—we might peek at the second episode purely out of curiosity or social pressure. But even then, but it’s already dead in our eyes. These shows are simply a no-go. Cut them, and don't look back.</li>
      <li><span class="na">⚫ N/A – Disqualified You may not even notice, but why?</span> These aren't just shows you drop. They're shows you don't even register as something to drop. By the time you realize they exist, the judgment has already happened—silently, instinctively, irreversibly. You’re not even thinking “Should I keep watching this?” because you’ve already filed it under \"Not even worth considering.\" It’s not that they’re bad in a dramatic way—they’re just irrelevant. So utterly void of value or presence that you wouldn’t even call them anime, let alone something worth evaluating.<p>Think of it this way:<br>If someone asked, \"Hey, did you drop that show?\"<br> You’d honestly reply, \"What show?\"<br></p></li>
    </ul>

  disclaimer: `
  <div class="disclaimer-title">*Note on N/A Disqualified Tier:</div>
  Most titles in the N/A Disqualified tier were dropped or excluded from my watch pool after the first few episodes or even during it. Some didn’t last more than a few minutes, while others were ruled out at a glance—or not even. That doesn’t mean they’re all “absolute trash.” Most just weren’t my cup of tea or didn’t suit the ranking format. Some shows—even if good or fun in their own way—just don’t fit the structure or vibe of my weekly list. That said, yeah, a few were truly dookie.`,
