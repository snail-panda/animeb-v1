  seasonTitle: "2025 Spring Anime Season Premiere / First Impression Tier List ‚Äì Episode 1",
  seasonDate: "April 14, 2025",
  intro: "<p>The long-awaited <strong>Spring 2025 anime season</strong> has officially begun!</p> <p>This tier list covers <strong>all 46 shows</strong> I watched the first episodes of during Week 1. It‚Äôs based purely on <strong>first impressions</strong>‚Äîso I hope you‚Äôll take it as a casual and instinctive snapshot of how I felt after each premiere.</p> <p>That said, I didn‚Äôt make these picks randomly. Each placement reflects something that resonated with me: shows I enjoyed watching, ones that sparked curiosity, gave me a sense of potential, or simply made me want to keep going and see how they‚Äôll unfold.</p> <p>So with that in mind, here‚Äôs my <strong>Tier List for Week 1</strong>‚Äîhope you enjoy!</p>",
  content: "<p>Let's take a quick look at the Week 1 Tier List for Spring 2025. Honestly, this season is stacked with strong contenders. Interestingly, I didn't plan this at all, but the number of titles in each tier turned out to be pretty balanced. Each tier feels distinct, with its own flavor and character‚Äîand plenty of shows that truly represent what their tier stands for. It's a deep and entertaining pool in every sense.</p><p>Of course, anything A-tier and above is already worth watching. I'd say there are at least 12 or 13 shows this season that are clearly strong right out of the gate. There are quite a few in the B-tier as well‚Äîtitles with potential, but still hard to read at this point. And then‚Ä¶ yeah, there are a few that were clearly bad from the start. No surprises there.</p><p>As for the very top: <span class=\"anime-title\">The Apothecary Diaries</span> <span class=\"jp-title\">(Kusuriya no Hitorigoto)</span> and <span class=\"anime-title\">Shoshimin</span> <span class=\"jp-title\">(Shoushimin Series)</span> are my unshakable SS-tier locks. No need to explain why. In the S-tier, we've got <span class=\"anime-title\">Sword of the Demon Hunter</span> <span class=\"jp-title\">(Kijin Gentoushou)</span>‚Äîa really pleasant surprise, and honestly a joy to watch. Episode 1 gave me a real sense of conviction from Yokohama Animation Lab. And then there's <span class=\"anime-title\">Apocalypse Hotel</span>, which came out swinging with insane quality, courtesy of Cygames. I'm seriously excited to see where it goes.</p><p><span class=\"anime-title\">Lazaro</span> also deserves a mention. The animation, scale, and energy were overwhelming‚Äîbut where it's headed is still unclear. Still, the promise is there. All in all, the top of the list is packed with impressive work. I'm already looking forward to every week.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum‚Ä¶ yeah, <span class=\"anime-title\">Anne Shirley</span> is a no-go for me. That thing was a disaster. It was way too rushed‚Äîhonestly, borderline disrespectful in how much was cut. Sure, some newcomers might still find it touching, and it's not unwatchable. But if you imagine the same treatment being done to a work you love? Yeah. That's how I feel.</p><p>The stuff I dropped? You'll understand right away if you saw them. Just no saving them. As for disqualified or ineligible shows‚Äîthey weren't necessarily awful, but they didn't feel like they belonged on this list in the first place. So yeah, those were easy cuts.</p><p>In short: there are tons of shows worth checking out this season, and I'm genuinely excited to see how things evolve. I plan to do another tier list around Week 6‚Äîright at the halfway point‚Äîso we'll see who rises, who falls, and who disappears entirely. Stay tuned!</p>",
  conclusion: "<p>And that wraps up my rough overall summary of the Spring 2025 anime Tier List based on all the first episodes I watched.</p><p>To be honest, there were a few more shows I started‚Äîbut some were so bad I had to drop them mid-episode, or even just a few seconds in. They didn't make it here, for obvious reasons.</p><p>If you're looking for a more detailed breakdown or wider thoughts on the season, feel free to check out the Week 1 Overview in the Weekly Ranking. You'll also find more individual impressions in the reviews section of that post.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, I'm already super excited to see how the Spring 2025 season unfolds from here. The plan is to do another tier list update around Week 6, at the halfway mark‚Äîso I'll see you again then!</p><p>And as always, feel free to drop your own thoughts or favorite titles in the comments. See you next time!</p>",

      <li><span class="ss">üî¥ SS ‚Äì CELESTIAL</span> Cr√®me de la cr√®me. Absolute must-watch.</li>
      <li><span class="s">üü† S ‚Äì GREAT</span> Strong execution and great energy, just shy of that tiny spark of god-tier brilliance. This is where recommendations really start.</li>
      <li><span class="a">üü° A ‚Äì GOOD</span> Solid work, still holding attention. Definitely enjoyable, but started wobbling, or vice versa.</li>
      <li><span class="b">‚ö™ B ‚Äì DECENT</span> Not essential, but fully watchable. Perfectly fine for light watching. You won't miss much if you skip it.</li>
      <li><span class="c">üü¢ C ‚Äì BAD / ABYSMAL</span> As most things fail to click, but faint hope still lingers if a few pieces finally fall into place.</li>
      <li><span class="d">üîª D ‚Äì TRASH</span> Pure trash barely justifying watch time. But sometimes bad enough for fun, creating twisted flashes of charm. Falling apart ‚Äî yet weirdly still a part of what makes the full anime season complete.</li>
      <li><span class="dropped">üîµ DROPPED / PICKING BACK UP</span> Dropped for now. Some might get another shot to win me back. We‚Äôll see.</li>
      <li><span class="na">‚ö´ N/A ‚Äì Disqualified</span> Judgement made. In the void.</li>

  <div class="disclaimer-title">*Note on N/A Disqualified Tier:</div>
  Most titles in the N/A Disqualified tier were dropped or excluded from my watch pool after the first few episodes or even during it. Some didn‚Äôt last more than a few minutes, while others were ruled out at a glance‚Äîor not even. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre all ‚Äúabsolute trash.‚Äù Most just weren‚Äôt my cup of tea or didn‚Äôt suit the ranking format. Some shows‚Äîeven if good or fun in their own way‚Äîjust don‚Äôt fit the structure or vibe of my weekly list. That said, yeah, a few were truly dookie.`,
