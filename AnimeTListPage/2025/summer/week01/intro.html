<p>Before the excitement of the <strong>Spring cour</strong> had even settled, the <strong>Summer 2025 anime season</strong> has already kicked off.</p>

<p>This tier list reflects my impressions of the <strong>59 (+7) shows</strong> I sampled at the start of the season. As always, it's based purely on <strong>first impressions</strong>—a casual and intuitive snapshot of how I felt after watching each premiere.</p>

<p>That said, while the list may look spontaneous, every placement is intentional and shaped by my personal tastes: shows that intrigued me, sparked curiosity, gave me a sense of promise, or simply made me want to keep going and see more.</p>

<p>Of course, I did my best to remain as <strong>objective</strong> as possible—even while trusting my gut. This list also factors in whether I'd want to continue watching a show or consider it for future weekly rankings.</p>

<p>Please note that some titles are not included—either because they hadn't aired yet at the time of writing, or because I didn't watch them (and likely won't). You'll find those omitted near the bottom of the list.</p>

<p>Also excluded are three continuing titles from the Spring season: <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>KIJIN GENTOUSHOU</em>), <strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>), and <strong>Witch Watch</strong>.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, here's my very first <strong>Tier List for Week 1 of the Summer 2025 season</strong>—hope you enjoy!</p>
