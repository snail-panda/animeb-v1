    <h4 class="criteria-title">Tier Guide</h4>
    <ul class="criteria-list">
      <li><span class="ss">🔴 SS – CELESTIAL Lucky you found a treasure!</span> Overwhelmingly captivating in one or more areas—be it narrative brilliance, emotional depth, character impact, sheer originality, or inspired world-building. Encountering this show sparks joy and excitement. Completion is practically guaranteed—you're certain to see it through to the end. It already feels destined for a top-tier finish. In other words, absolute must-watch. </li>
      <li><span class="s">🟠 S – GREAT Almost perfectly sure to go all the way—and enjoy every step.</span> Strongly engaging and rewarding—there's already enough substance or quality in this episode to make continuing feel like a given. You're quite likely to stick with it through the middle or even the final stretch, barring any major drop-off. A high-quality first episode or a clear sense of accomplishment and enjoyment justifies a strong early score. No clear negative signals to stop watching yet. You don't have other options—you should definitely not miss any titles from this tier. </li>
      <li><span class="a">🟡 A – GOOD You'll gladly stick around at least half way.</span> There’s something clearly good here. While it might not hit with overwhelming impact, it definitely left a strong impression—whether in tone, worldbuilding, characters, or potential. You can sense that it *clicked* on some level and sparked curiosity. There’s enough resonance to say, “This could turn into something great,” and you’re motivated to keep watching—maybe 3 or 4 more episodes—to see how it unfolds. It's not quite a sure bet yet, but it's absolutely worth the time.</li>
      <li><span class="b">⚪ B – DECENT Not essential. Maybe 3-4 eps? Up to you.</span> Perfectly fine for a light watch. The episode wasn’t bad at all—it had its moments—You might even find a few things you liked, but it didn’t really grab you either. It’s the kind of show where you think, “I could keep watching a couple more episodes,” but you’re not exactly excited. There might be potential, or maybe just enough intrigue to continue. At the same time, it wouldn't be a loss if you skipped it—there’s no strong hook, just a decent start.</li>
      <li><span class="c">🟢 C – BAD / ABYSMAL Should be dropped, but you might give it 1-2 more tries.</span> These shows tend to have one or more clearly disappointing aspects—whether it’s the visuals, the script, or the overall execution. That doesn’t mean they’re outright terrible; in fact, there’s often some appeal in the concept, setup, or worldbuilding. But something feels noticeably off. Maybe the art quality isn’t *terrible*, but it’s inconsistent or bland. Maybe the characters are somewhat appealing, but their actions or dialogue feel awkward or unconvincing. Maybe the story has potential, but key moments are glossed over or poorly delivered. It’s the kind of show that gives off the sense of being underbaked—like it’s missing a layer of polish or care. Still, there’s often a flicker of potential that makes you say, “Maybe I’ll give it one more episode,” even if you’re already thinking of cutting it soon. And of course, if you're not a hard core anime nerd, don't think, just drop it. </li>
      <li><span class="d">🔻 D – TRASH Don't unless you're into trash. Just like me.</span> These are shows that are fundamentally flawed—whether due to an uninspired story, recycled character archetypes, or laughably predictable developments. You’ve seen it all before: the overpowered, oblivious protagonist, the world running on convenient coincidences, the same character dynamics used for the hundredth time. Most of these titles feel like they were made to fill a slot rather than tell a story. That said, there’s still a certain beauty in failure—a kind of unintentional comedy or genre self-parody that can make them oddly watchable. In most cases, you’ll drop them after one episode. But sometimes, out of sheer curiosity or pity, you might give them a second look. If you understand what trash is—and you still choose to watch—it’s your journey to take. There’s an elegance to garbage, after all. And if you’re the kind of viewer who dares to sift through the muck in search of hidden sparkle, then who’s to say what value you might find?</li>
      <li><span class="dropped">🔵 DROPPED / PICKING BACK UP Some might still watch it—but not you.</span> These are shows that not only fail to present any reason to keep watching, but go as far as to trigger anger, disgust, or utter disbelief. They often include elements that feel unforgivable or outright infuriating. Despite our usual effort to be generous with first impressions, any show that manages to score in the 4s (or below 5) right from episode 1 has, by definition, failed beyond saving. There’s no second-guessing—these shows are dropped instantly. They’re not worth your time, attention, or even a hate-watch.  Occasionally, in rare cases—like when the show is an exceptionally hot topic—we might peek at the second episode purely out of curiosity or social pressure. But even then, but it’s already dead in our eyes. These shows are simply a no-go. Cut them, and don't look back.</li>
      <li><span class="na">⚫ N/A – Disqualified These aren't something to watch, are they?</span> These aren't just shows you drop. They're shows you don't even register as something to drop. By the time you realize they exist, the judgment has already happened—silently, instinctively, irreversibly. You’re not even thinking “Should I keep watching this?” because you’ve already filed it under \"Not even worth considering.\" It’s not that they’re bad in a dramatic way—they’re just irrelevant. So utterly void of value or presence that you wouldn’t even call them anime, let alone something worth evaluating.<p>Think of it this way:<br>If someone asked, \"Hey, did you drop that show?\"<br> You’d honestly reply, \"What show?\"<br></p></li>
    </ul>

  <div class="disclaimer-title">*Note on N/A Disqualified Tier:</div>
  Most titles in the N/A Disqualified tier were dropped or excluded from my watch pool after the first few episodes or even during it. Some didn’t last more than a few minutes, while others were ruled out at a glance—or not even. That doesn’t mean they’re all “absolute trash.” Most just weren’t my cup of tea or didn’t suit the ranking format. Some shows—even if good or fun in their own way—just don’t fit the structure or vibe of my weekly list. That said, yeah, a few were truly dookie.`,
