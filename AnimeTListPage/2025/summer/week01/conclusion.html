<p>And that wraps up my rough overall summary of the Summer 2025 anime Tier List, based on all the first—and in some cases, second—episodes I watched.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a more detailed breakdown or broader impressions of the season, check out the Week 1 Overview in the Weekly Ranking. You’ll also find more specific thoughts in the individual reviews there.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, I’m already super curious to see how the Summer 2025 season unfolds. The plan is to post a TierList update around Week 6, at the halfway mark—so I’ll see you again then!</p>

<p>As always, feel free to drop your own thoughts or favorite titles in the comments. See you next time!</p>
