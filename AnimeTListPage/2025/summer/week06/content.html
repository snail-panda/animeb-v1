<p>The mid-season tier highlight definitely revolves around the sub-top tiers like A, B, and C. While SS, S, and D are pretty much locked in — with  
  <span class="anime-title">The Apothecary Diaries Second Season</span> <span class="jp-title">(Kusuriya no Hitorigoto)</span>,  
  <span class="anime-title">Sword of the Demon Hunter</span> <span class="jp-title">(Kijin Gentoushou)</span>, and  
  <span class="anime-title">Shoshimin: How to Become Ordinary 2</span> <span class="jp-title">(Shoushimin Series 2nd Season)</span>  
  absolutely dominating the top, and certain bottom-tier shows still proudly claiming their D-tier status — the real action lies in the middle.</p>

<p>Mid-tier titles such as  
  <span class="anime-title">Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</span> <span class="jp-title">(Kidou Senshi Gundam GQuuuuuuX)</span>,  
  <span class="anime-title">Kowloon Generic Romance</span>, and  
  <span class="anime-title">From the Old Country Bumpkin to Master Swordsman...</span> <span class="jp-title">(Katainaka no Ossan Kensei ni Naru)</span>  
  are still holding some potential to rise — though honestly, they're quite wobbly. From my personal view, Gundam and From the Old... have finally started showing some of their own charm, though not fully baked yet.  
  And the thing is — back in Episode 1, these were among the shows I was really excited about. I hope the next few episodes will give them the push they need to live up to that early promise.</p>
