  seasonDate: "July 27, 2025",
  intro: "<p>Before the excitement of the <strong>Spring cour</strong> had even settled, the <strong>Summer 2025 anime season</strong> has already kicked off.</p><p>This tier list reflects my impressions of the <strong>59 (+7) shows</strong> I sampled at the start of the season. As always, it's based purely on <strong>first impressions</strong>—a casual and intuitive snapshot of how I felt after watching each premiere.</p><p>That said, while the list may look spontaneous, every placement is intentional and shaped by my personal tastes: shows that intrigued me, sparked curiosity, gave me a sense of promise, or simply made me want to keep going and see more.</p><p>Of course, I did my best to remain as <strong>objective</strong> as possible—even while trusting my gut. This list also factors in whether I'd want to continue watching a show or consider it for future weekly rankings.</p><p>Please note that some titles are not included—either because they hadn't aired yet at the time of writing, or because I didn't watch them (and likely won't). You'll find those omitted near the bottom of the list.</p><p>Also excluded are three continuing titles from the Spring season: <strong>Sword of the Demon Hunter</strong> (<em>KIJIN GENTOUSHOU</em>), <strong>Me and the Alien MuMu</strong> (<em>Uchuujin MuuMuu</em>), and <strong>Witch Watch</strong>.</p><p>With that out of the way, here's my very first <strong>Tier List for Week 1 of the Summer 2025 season</strong>—hope you enjoy!</p>",
  content: "<p>Let’s dive into our <strong>2025 Summer Anime Season Premiere First Impression TierList</strong>—Episode 1 edition. While the label says “Episode 1,” some of the shows included here actually had two episodes out by the time of evaluation, so keep in mind that some first impressions are based on Episodes 1 and 2.</p><p>Now, first off—this season is massive. At the very beginning, I had over 100 titles on my radar—somewhere around 104–105. From there, I narrowed it down to around 60–70 that seemed worth checking out. In the end, I gave scores to 45 shows based on actual viewing and evaluation. These are the titles that make up this TierList.</p><p>The structure remains the same: tiers run from SS to D, followed by Dropped and Disqualified sections. Realistically, the SS to D range represents my serious evaluation tier—basically, the works I consider worth ranking. Since I try to keep this group under 30 titles for sanity’s sake, I had to make some hard cuts. Some shows didn’t click with me. Others just didn’t feel worth scoring. And yes, there are a few that simply weren’t good. But these are my choices—subjective, of course, but honest.</p><p><strong>Overall First Impression?</strong><br>Despite the massive quantity... things aren’t exactly promising.</p><p>Frankly, this summer season feels underwhelming so far. Coming off an extremely strong spring season, the bar was high—and this batch stumbled. The big names, the sequels, the new hype shows—none of them really wowed me in their premiere episodes. The visual quality standard across the board has definitely risen, that’s true—but in terms of depth, narrative density, or emotional impact, many titles felt flat, flimsy, or forgettable.</p><p><strong>Let’s talk highlights:</strong><br>No SS-tier shows this time. That’s rare. Not a single show felt like a true knockout from the get-go.</p><p>S-tier has just one entry: <strong>Takopi's Original Sin</strong> (<em>Takopii no Genzai</em>). It hit hard. It was impactful. But honestly, it left me confused about how to interpret it. It definitely intrigued me—but I couldn't yet decide how I felt about it. Hence, S-tier.</p><p>I also enjoyed <strong>Ruri Rocks</strong> (<em>Ruri no Houseki</em>). It had charm and shine. Was it flawless? No. The storytelling felt clunky and convenient at times, but it definitely sparked interest.</p><p><strong>Dekin no Mogura: The Earthbound Mole</strong> was another title I found oddly compelling. It’s hard to explain—there’s just something about it. I didn’t vibe with this creator’s previous work, but this one feels more promising.</p><p><strong>Clevatess</strong> (<em>Clevatess: Majuu no Ou to Akago to Kabane no Yuusha</em>) made a strong first impression. Visually striking, impactful, and it gave the sense that there’s real strength beneath the surface. Hopefully it keeps that momentum going.</p><p><strong>And the rest?</strong><br>Most shows... just didn’t land. Not terrible, but not worth a spot on the board either.</p><p>For instance:</p><p><strong>Call of the Night Season 2</strong> (<em>Yofukashi no Uta</em>)—I adored the first season. It was one of my favorites when it aired. So naturally, I was thrilled to see Season 2 kick off this summer. That said, my expectations may have been a little too high. Episode 1 felt a bit off—like it lacked the spark and dreamy pull that made the first season special. There were glimpses of that magic, especially in the zoo scene near the end, but overall it left me feeling unsure. Still, the visuals are stunning, Creepy Nuts is back with perfect music, and I’m hopeful this season just needs a bit of time to find its rhythm.</p><p><strong>City The Animation</strong> is based on a manga by Keiichi Arawi, the same creator behind <strong>Nichijou</strong>, which I absolutely love. Naturally, I was hyped when I heard it was getting an anime adaptation—and by none other than Kyoto Animation. Visually, it’s breathtaking. Seriously, the animation is so polished it’s almost absurd—in the best way. But content-wise? It didn’t land for me. The humor felt off. I wanted to love it, but Episode 1 didn’t click. Still, it’s early days, and maybe it’ll settle into its groove—but so far, not quite the spiritual successor to <strong>Nichijou</strong> I was hoping for.</p><p><strong>The Summer Hikaru Died</strong> (<em>Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu</em>) was one of the season’s most talked-about premieres—visually stunning, no doubt—but I’ve personally hit my limit with occult/horror themes. It didn’t resonate.<br>That said, part of the disconnect wasn’t just the genre fatigue. I also struggled to connect with the core relationship between the two boys—Yoshiki and Hikaru. Their dynamic felt vague, emotionally distant, and hard to parse. There’s clearly something huge and supernatural going on, but it’s all presented so matter-of-factly that I wasn’t sure how I was supposed to feel. The atmosphere is thick, the mystery is real, but I couldn’t bring myself to care about either character.<br>Is this meant to be a deeply emotional story? A slow-burn horror? Something BL-adjacent? I honestly couldn’t tell. Everything felt emotionally muffled and thematically unclear. As of now, I just don’t feel compelled to keep watching.</p><p>Even comedy-romance stuff felt off. <strong>Grand Blue Dreaming Season 2</strong> (<em>Grand Blue 2nd Season</em>) came back after nearly eight years, and I was genuinely looking forward to it. Season 1 was completely unhinged—in the best way possible. It was wild, ridiculous, and hilarious, but somehow, it worked. That chaotic energy made it charming and addictive.<br>But this first episode of Season 2? Something just felt… off. The tone had shifted, the jokes didn’t land, and the animation seemed noticeably worse. It was still nonsense, sure—but not the kind that makes you laugh. It just felt empty, aimless, and awkward.<br>When a sequel returns after so many years, you'd expect the first episode to either reestablish its world or at least recapture the spirit of what made it popular. Instead, it dropped us into a bizarre scenario that failed to be funny, failed to be nostalgic, and failed to explain anything. I couldn't tell who this was supposed to appeal to—or what it was even trying to be.<br>It wasn’t just confusing—it was disappointing. And honestly, I couldn’t help but think: Was this really the same show I once loved?</p><p>In contrast, shows like <strong>Fermat no Ryouri</strong> and <strong>Turkey!</strong>, both of which got buzz for being over-the-top ridiculous, were honestly more fun to watch. Goofy, silly, but entertaining.</p><p>Also, as a big fan of Hanada Jukki’s writing, I was delighted by <strong>See You Tomorrow at the Food Court</strong> (<em>Food Court de, Mata Ashita</em>). It’s not your typical anime—it's more like a low-key sketch or sitcom, with two high school girls chatting in the same food court every episode. But the writing sparkles: unique, sharp, and unexpectedly funny.</p><p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br>This wasn’t a strong first week overall. But I’m not throwing in the towel. Some shows take time to warm up. I’m giving them a few more episodes to evolve. But on the flip side, if something’s clearly garbage? I’m dropping it fast.<br>And yes—let me say this: I still don’t trust CloverWorks. Let’s see if they can actually deliver a coherent story from start to finish this time. Episode 1 (or even 2) didn’t leave much impact, so I’m watching with caution.</p><p>That’s it for now. Let’s see how the rest of the season shapes up.</p>",
  conclusion: "<p>And that wraps up my rough overall summary of the Summer 2025 anime Tier List, based on all the first—and in some cases, second—episodes I watched.</p><p>If you're looking for a more detailed breakdown or broader impressions of the season, check out the Week 1 Overview in the Weekly Ranking. You’ll also find more specific thoughts in the individual reviews there.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, I’m already super curious to see how the Summer 2025 season unfolds. The plan is to post a TierList update around Week 6, at the halfway mark—so I’ll see you again then!</p><p>As always, feel free to drop your own thoughts or favorite titles in the comments. See you next time!</p>",

  tierGuide: `
    <h4 class="criteria-title">Tier Guide</h4>
    <ul class="criteria-list">
      <li><span class="ss">🔴 SS – CELESTIAL Lucky you found a treasure!</span> Overwhelmingly captivating in one or more areas—be it narrative brilliance, emotional depth, character impact, sheer originality, or inspired world-building. Encountering this show sparks joy and excitement. Completion is practically guaranteed—you're certain to see it through to the end. It already feels destined for a top-tier finish. In other words, absolute must-watch. </li>
      <li><span class="s">🟠 S – GREAT Almost perfectly sure to go all the way—and enjoy every step.</span> Strongly engaging and rewarding—there's already enough substance or quality in this episode to make continuing feel like a given. You're quite likely to stick with it through the middle or even the final stretch, barring any major drop-off. A high-quality first episode or a clear sense of accomplishment and enjoyment justifies a strong early score. No clear negative signals to stop watching yet. You don't have other options—you should definitely not miss any titles from this tier. </li>
      <li><span class="a">🟡 A – GOOD You'll gladly stick around at least half way.</span> There’s something clearly good here. While it might not hit with overwhelming impact, it definitely left a strong impression—whether in tone, worldbuilding, characters, or potential. You can sense that it *clicked* on some level and sparked curiosity. There’s enough resonance to say, “This could turn into something great,” and you’re motivated to keep watching—maybe 3 or 4 more episodes—to see how it unfolds. It's not quite a sure bet yet, but it's absolutely worth the time.</li>
      <li><span class="b">⚪ B – DECENT Not essential. Maybe 3-4 eps? Up to you.</span> Perfectly fine for a light watch. The episode wasn’t bad at all—it had its moments—You might even find a few things you liked, but it didn’t really grab you either. It’s the kind of show where you think, “I could keep watching a couple more episodes,” but you’re not exactly excited. There might be potential, or maybe just enough intrigue to continue. At the same time, it wouldn't be a loss if you skipped it—there’s no strong hook, just a decent start.</li>
      <li><span class="c">🟢 C – BAD / ABYSMAL Should be dropped, but you might give it 1-2 more tries.</span> These shows tend to have one or more clearly disappointing aspects—whether it’s the visuals, the script, or the overall execution. That doesn’t mean they’re outright terrible; in fact, there’s often some appeal in the concept, setup, or worldbuilding. But something feels noticeably off. Maybe the art quality isn’t *terrible*, but it’s inconsistent or bland. Maybe the characters are somewhat appealing, but their actions or dialogue feel awkward or unconvincing. Maybe the story has potential, but key moments are glossed over or poorly delivered. It’s the kind of show that gives off the sense of being underbaked—like it’s missing a layer of polish or care. Still, there’s often a flicker of potential that makes you say, “Maybe I’ll give it one more episode,” even if you’re already thinking of cutting it soon. And of course, if you're not a hard core anime nerd, don't think, just drop it. </li>
      <li><span class="d">🔻 D – TRASH Don't unless you're into trash. Just like me.</span> These are shows that are fundamentally flawed—whether due to an uninspired story, recycled character archetypes, or laughably predictable developments. You’ve seen it all before: the overpowered, oblivious protagonist, the world running on convenient coincidences, the same character dynamics used for the hundredth time. Most of these titles feel like they were made to fill a slot rather than tell a story. That said, there’s still a certain beauty in failure—a kind of unintentional comedy or genre self-parody that can make them oddly watchable. In most cases, you’ll drop them after one episode. But sometimes, out of sheer curiosity or pity, you might give them a second look. If you understand what trash is—and you still choose to watch—it’s your journey to take. There’s an elegance to garbage, after all. And if you’re the kind of viewer who dares to sift through the muck in search of hidden sparkle, then who’s to say what value you might find?</li>
      <li><span class="dropped">🔵 DROPPED / PICKING BACK UP Some might still watch it—but not you.</span> These are shows that not only fail to present any reason to keep watching, but go as far as to trigger anger, disgust, or utter disbelief. They often include elements that feel unforgivable or outright infuriating. Despite our usual effort to be generous with first impressions, any show that manages to score in the 4s (or below 5) right from episode 1 has, by definition, failed beyond saving. There’s no second-guessing—these shows are dropped instantly. They’re not worth your time, attention, or even a hate-watch.  Occasionally, in rare cases—like when the show is an exceptionally hot topic—we might peek at the second episode purely out of curiosity or social pressure. But even then, but it’s already dead in our eyes. These shows are simply a no-go. Cut them, and don't look back.</li>
      <li><span class="na">⚫ N/A – Disqualified These aren't something to watch, are they?</span> These aren't just shows you drop. They're shows you don't even register as something to drop. By the time you realize they exist, the judgment has already happened—silently, instinctively, irreversibly. You’re not even thinking “Should I keep watching this?” because you’ve already filed it under \"Not even worth considering.\" It’s not that they’re bad in a dramatic way—they’re just irrelevant. So utterly void of value or presence that you wouldn’t even call them anime, let alone something worth evaluating.<p>Think of it this way:<br>If someone asked, \"Hey, did you drop that show?\"<br> You’d honestly reply, \"What show?\"<br></p></li>
    </ul>

  disclaimer: `
  <div class="disclaimer-title">*Note on N/A Disqualified Tier:</div>
  Most titles in the N/A Disqualified tier were dropped or excluded from my watch pool after the first few episodes or even during it. Some didn’t last more than a few minutes, while others were ruled out at a glance—or not even. That doesn’t mean they’re all “absolute trash.” Most just weren’t my cup of tea or didn’t suit the ranking format. Some shows—even if good or fun in their own way—just don’t fit the structure or vibe of my weekly list. That said, yeah, a few were truly dookie.`,
